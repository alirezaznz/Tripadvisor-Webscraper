Pumberry Hotel,,2.0,Poor,-1,-1,-1,twsnit,Started well,"After turning up after a night shift and a 4 hour drive. Check in was smooth, given key card to the room, small and all looked well. Until I tried to shower before a nap, shower blocked ok these thing happen. I head downstairs to let reception know, the young lad on reception told me it will be sorted ASAP, thank you! After a quick beer in the bar unfortunately only bottles available, that I could of got in the garage next door for the fraction of the price but couldn’t take it to the room. After returning to the room all of my towels had been used to mop the floor and the contents of the blockage of the shower were left in the tray! Hair and scum everywhere.After walking down to reception for the 3rd time this time to get fresh towels. When I finally managed to get a shower I realised the top of the shower door was loaded with the past guests soap and flannel!! Was such a shame great location and a nice room for the price, attention to detail won’t go a miss, again a great shame as we are heading back to seven sisters a lot over the next few months. So any tips on other hotels won’t go Amis",May 2019,2.0,13,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,Clare C,Christmas Trip,"Myself and my daughter booked this hotel as it was the best value for our needs. I had no expectations as this was a 1st for me.  We got to the hotel at lunch time where the staff were more than happy to take our luggage whilst we went off sightseeing. We returned later in the evening and decided to eat at the hotel, very nice food. I was very impressed with our twin room, beds slightly too close for my daughter's liking but .... How comfy were those beds. It was amazing. Nice and clean good size towells that actually fit the larger frame. I slept like a log. The shower was good , nice and hot. Breakfast had a good choice of hot and cold items with plenty of tea,coffee and juice. We stayed 2 nights and on the final day we left our luggage again whilst we went to Westfield. Thinking we'd shop all day and just pop back for our bags, however we'd had enough just after lunch. We walked back to the hotel and they very kindly let us stay in the foyer with all our bags for over 3 hours until we got a taxi to catch our coach.

I've stayed in these express type hotels before and am usually underwhelmed.  Its actually a great little hotel and exceeded my expectations. The bed was super comfy, there was a spacious bathroom with a powerful shower, and a decent TV with a little chaise lounge / sofa to sprawl on. Free tea and coffee making facilities and a fairly decent room service menu.  Great friendly staff, and a little bar/restaurant downstairs. And spotlessly clean! Very reasonably priced. Cant work out why this is only a three star.  Would stay again.",December 2019,5.0,26,Traveled on business,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,-1,5.0
Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,DaveWNorfolk,Excellent!,"Overnight stay for 2 days in London. Chose the location as we would be driving to Epping and getting the tube in and this was conveniently located.We wanted to make the most of our 2 days so I contacted hotel in advance to ask if we arrived early could we store our bag and go out for the day, they said yes but would put a note on system to try and get us an early checkin. When we arrived we were able to check in straight away.My wife is a wheelchair user and the lovely lady on reception came to a lower counter and checked us in and checked all was ok and if we needed anything to ask.We had booked an accessible room which was huge and met my wifes needs perfectly after a quick cuppa we hit London!!Coming back in the evening we stopped in the bar for a couple of drinks which were reasonable priced for a London hotel and the bar was comfy and the staff friendly.The bed in the room was very comfy, it was a cold day and it took me a while to work out the heating even though it had instructions but once on the room warmed up quickly. The allocation of Tea and coffee in the room was a tad stingy but they let you get more which was fine.Did not hear any noise and after a great nights sleep, buffet breakfast was lovely especially the sauasages.Didn't have to check out too early so did not need to rush, took bad to reception to be stored while we hit London again, different staff member on reception but again very friendly.Didn't have to wait long to collect bag that evening and staff member wished us a safe journey home.Hotel is a short walk from Stratford Station but if you are feeling lazy you can hop onto a DLR to stratford high street which is even closer!! However if you do the latter note that trains run every 10 mins on that section and you could probably walk and be at the hotel before the train if you have just missed one.Would definitely come back in future",December 2019,5.0,77,not mentioned,5.0,5.0,-1,5.0,-1,-1

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,SBCTouristas,Very Impressed,"We were here for the London 6-Day race at the nearby velodrome and were impressed right from the start of our stay. Our welcome at reception (sorry can't remember the name but very pleasant young man) on arrival was brilliant and our room on the 5th floor in superb clean and bright condition. We are familiar with the Holiday Inn Express breakfast and it is the main reason we use this chain. It was just as we expected which, for us, means plenty of choice but just as much as you want i.e. not paying for masses of stuff you don't really want. The location was fine for us having researched beforehand the route to the nearest tube station at Stratford. This station served well all the areas we had intended to visit during our stay e.g. The Velodrome, Canary Wharf, O2, Emirates cable car, Thames pedestrian tunnel to Cutty Sark and Greenwich Observatory, the West End, Green Park, The Palace, and Westminster. We had worried before our arrival at what the atmosphere in Stratford would be like given the tragic stabbing a couple of weeks before, but we were actually surprised at how open and friendly local people we met were. The icing on the cake for us was finding that many of the riders and support staff for the race were also staying at the hotel and we actually met an old friend who we had not seen for many years who was working as mechanic to some of the riders. We also met the winner of the mens race, Elia Viviani and GB womens star Laura Kenny to cap an excellent stay.",October 2019,4.0,177,not mentioned,-1,-1,4.0,4.0,4.0,-1

I must say from the get-go I did not have any major expectations being a 3 -star hotel. However, I left impressed with the good customer service on arrival and throughout. The front of house staff, bar staff and cleaners were friendly. I was given one of the newer rooms on the 5th floor which was cosey, clean, a little spacious and soundproof. There was some tea and coffee facilities, iron & ironing board and menu for room service. I ordered Takeaway for dinner but had the Hotel food for breakfast which came with the booking. It was Buffett style -  the standard English breakfast, cereals, hot drinks, juices and some fruits. It was quite busy (I came down half an hour before breakfast ended) so I took my food to consume in my room which tasted fine. The staff were very helpful during breakfast seeing to some visitors specific needs. The only thing I will note which was is not a major issue is that were only two lifts and it often took a couple of minutes to get one, but aside from that, my experience was great. For a 3-star place, this hotel offers great value for money considering the service, the comfort beds + pillows and warmth experienced. I will definitely return if prices are reasonable.",October 2019,5.0,12,not mentioned,5.0,4.0,-1,5.0,-1,-1

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,Steve Medhurst,Feeling ripped off,"I booked this hotel about 3 weeks prior to the Prudential Ride London that started just around the corner.I could not get a single night booking (fair enough) so opted for 2 nights and was quoted £200 for the room on their reservations line for a 2 night stay which given that they advertise rooms at £50-£60 a night was still a bit inflated. I was very clear that this was £200 for 2 nights however I did not receive a confirmation email as promised but I did have a booking reference so was not too bothered.On arrival I was told that the room was £400 for 2 nights which I queried and assured them that I was quoted £200. I was then told it was £200 per night but handed a check in form with £100 per night on this and then told that the second night was £300 which made no sense at all. I spoke with the manager who then confirmed that regardless it was still £400 so take it or leave it (my words not hers).Having trained up for this event for 9 months and standing there with my bike and kit I did not have much choice so reluctantly paid up.No complaints about the hotel and facilities, the room was compact but well fitted and comfortable and they even put on breakfast for competitors at 4.30 am on Sunday morning (had to be at the start by 5,20 am). On another occasion I would highly recommend this place as it is a stones throw from the Olympic Park and probably at more reasonable rates.Definitely feel ripped off and my charity ride costing twice what i had bargained for.",August 2019,4.0,1,not mentioned,-1,5.0,-1,4.0,-1,4.0

It's a hotel that is situated in a place that was close to where I needed it to be. The front desk staff tried really hard and that is to be commended, the room in which we stayed had the requisite number of beds and it also had an ensuite bathroom. The bathroom was useful for using the toilet and for washing, the beds proved adequate for the purpose of sleeping.One great point was the breakfast service. This started early and that suited us because we needed to be out early, the range of food was good and quantities plentiful. Breakfast was included in the price of the room.This review would not be complete if I didn't mention one irritating point that upset me. When I booked the room they said that tea and coffee making equipment was provided in the room, however, there were only two teabags and four UHT milks provided. I'm sure everyone would agree that this is a woefully inadequate provision for an English hotel?So in summary, it's a hotel close to somewhere nearby, the service is adequate if you're not keen on tea.",July 2019,4.0,15,Traveled with family,-1,4.0,-1,5.0,3.0,-1

I explained my situation and need for immediate shelter for me and also for my daughter and her boy friend ( by the way, I was assisted by two representatives, don't know their names, but they were wonderful)  The representatives were able to book us for the evening, which was a God sent.  Unfortunately, they were unable to book us beyond the evening due to the hotel being full for the Red Sox-Yankees baseball game.  They connected with other local Holiday Inns, but they were also booked, they referred us to the Travel Lodge, across the street, and they were able to find a a convenient location after our night at the Holiday Inn.  The rooms were great.  Clean, comfortable.  The breakfast the next morning was very good and again  the morning staff was very helpful..The Holiday Inn and the staff made what could have been a complete disaster a very positive experience.

The room was clean and well presented, bathroom clean and well presented and had an ironing board, an iron, hairdryer and in-room safe!! Speechless!!!

The staff were really excellent. Lovely bloke called Mo on reception who was really helpful, very pleasant and very efficient. Also a lovely young woman called Hashin (?) who was in the restaurant at breakfast was so sweet and watched one of my boys whilst I took the other to the toilet. Both members of staff were really kind, interacted really lovely with my children and seemed to understood the challenges of being on my own with two very lively boys. On the day we were due to checkout, my husband joined us and brought the boys to breakfast. Hashin noted my absence and checked very politely as to where I was! We both very much welcomed this vigilance. I think this hotel is possibly used mainly by people on business. We stayed here because it was very good value and the location suited us to visit friends in East London and get into London quite easily. Everything in the room worked (and I think they put us in a quiet area of the hotel) and it was dead easy. On site parking was very limited but following advice we got there early and it was very handy being able to get stuff from the car to the room etc. Couldn't recommend this hotel enough. xxx And the breakfast was lovely too xxx",May 2019,5.0,16,Traveled with family,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,5.0,-1

From there you can take the Jubilee and Central Tube lines, to central London. Helpful and nice Staff at the reception. Good regular hotel room. A little bit too small for 3 people. English breakfast has quite a lot of variety. Enough to start the day. There are fruits, but not vegetables. Coffee from the machine is ok. Food (dinner) at the bar was good, and reasonably priced.We had only one issue: At the first 2 days the room has been poorly cleaned. After we complained, it was ok during the next days.The room price is very reasonable, comparing to very high prices in the center of London. Good price for value.

Was pleasantly surprised when we entered our room as usually stay in Premier Inns and did not expect it to be as good.  However our room was spotless, spacious, very modern and I did actually say Wow upon entering.  The bathroom was sparkling with complimentary washing toiletries.  There was an ironing board, iron and normal hairdryer (not the attached to the bathroom wall type so common in most hotels) as standard and kettle with good supply of tea, coffee, milk, sugar and sweeteners.  Breakfast, which is included in the price, was superb.  Advertised as continental so expected quite a basic fare but there was a great choice of cereals, fruit, yogurts, toast, jams, egg, bacon, sausages, pastries etc. Very impressed!  The hotel is located on quite a busy road but our room was located at the back so didn’t pose a problem, overlooked a primary school so extremely quiet during the night time hours.

I am a West Ham fan and we picked this hotel as it is a 10 minute walk from the London Stadium and I had a stadium tour booked. Likewise it is a 10 minute walk from the Stratford tube station and Stratford Westfield shopping centre. The hotel rooms are perfectly serviceable and clean. The staff were always keen to help you and check that everything was OK. Breakfast is included with the cost and it is a help yourself buffet style. All the food was good and set us up for a busy day. There are even ‘take out’ coffee cups so you can take some caffeine with you as you start the day.

OK, car parked in neighbouring ticketed bay while I checked in and unloaded my stuff. Hotel not phased about bikes in rooms. Then I went and parked in Westfield's car parks - about 15 minutes walk away and substantially cheaper than the hotel's £20 per car per night charge (I think my two days cost me about £16 at Westfield).Room was fairly standard HI Express fair, with bed, sofa(bed), desk, open hanging space, tea/coffee and kettle, mid-sized TV and a WC/shower 'corner'.All very clean and generally in good condition, as you'd expect from a fairly recent building.Staff on front desk and bar/restaurant I found to be very good. Helpful, cheerful, on hand if you needed them.Talking of bar/restaurant - a couple of nicely poured pints... there was a choice of lagers and Guinness on draft plus plenty of other options in the fridges.I ate here on both evenings - I was on my own and find if night one isn't bad it's easier to just stay put on another occasion.  Because of the event the hotel had arranged a buffet for Saturday dinner with a combination of great carb-heavy food for the cyclists. And very reasonably priced too at £14.The second (post-ride) evening I'm not sure I could've gone out even if I wanted to! 100 miles down all I wanted was some good comfort food and there was plenty to choose from on the regular menu.  Again I felt reasonably priced and certainly tasty and good quality.Overall I would stay here again for another event in the area - though it's not somewhere I would make a special trip for but then it's not that sort of place!",July 2018,4.0,59,Traveled solo,-1,5.0,-1,5.0,4.0,-1

I was then asked, "" has anyone mentioned the parking charges"" ? No - I was then informed it was £20.00 per night to park my car - it just gets better...Later the Lady Manager (who was trying to help) told me why the fiasco had ensued, my advice to anyone is do NOT under any circumstances use the Holiday Inn own site to make a reservation, use one of the third parties.Holiday Inn Express is becoming the Ryanair of the Hotel trade, take care when booking and read all the small print.As a goodwill gesture, some of the parking charges were refunded.Oh, and I paid with the CC'd that had allegedly been refused............",December 2017,3.0,16,Traveled with family,3.0,-1,-1,2.0,-1,4.0

We had one with a view across to the Olympic park, The car park is only small and I believe costs around £20 a night, spaces can't be reserved and I'd recommend if you're staying on a weekend parking at the Westfield Centre which does reduced rates for long weekend stays (we paid £13,50 from Saturday lunch to Monday morning). The breakfasts are quite extensive for this type of hotel not just continental but also bacon, sausages and scrambled egg. Lots of choice for coffee and tea too.

Unfortunately this was also the night that there was a terrorist attack at London Bridge so we stayed in the bar that night, staff made sure all guests were safe. The bar shuts around the 1am-1.30 mark. the next day we had breakfast before heading for home and staff kindly looked after our luggage.

Plump pillows and a duvet too.  TV etc etc.Worked for the night and breakfast was a buffet that had enough to suit a variety of tastes.

It's the thought that counts, right? We all have bad days, and TBH not in a horrid way it made me smile.Parking was a bit annoying as I checked if it was available and was told yes,only to find on arrival that it's £20 for the night.

Unfortunately I did not sleep for the two days I was there due to shockingly poor noise transfer. You can hear literally everything. We discovered we had a twin room with adjoining door to next room, but there were gaping gaps under the door. The first morning, we were awoken by the cleaners doing their rounds nearby.  Although the door to next room was locked, we were awoken at 6.45am on the second morning by a Spanish couple having an argument. Don't think about staying in the twin rooms unless you are completely comfortable with your roommate as they cannot even use the bathroom without it sounding like you are in the same room as them! There was no drinking water in the room although the bar were more than happy to give you a jug of water to take up. Breakfast is a buffet style but was very disorganised, with items not replenished at the same time.  So if you wanted the full English, you'd invariably be waiting for one or more items to be cooked at any one time. One good thing is that they provide you with paper bags to take items away should you wish. They also provide take away cups for hot drinks so if you are not a breakfast person first thing, you can still take some for your journey home or day out. The hotel also provide a small selection of magazines free of charge. The beds was comfortable enough but there were several areas of wear and tear in the room which looked very tired. On the whole, this hotel was clean enough and value for money in London but not the best place if you are a light sleeper (which I am not, by the way)!!",March 2017,2.0,5,Traveled with friends,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Not tolerant of people. Hates poor service. This hotel far exceeded my expectations and I'll return as soon as able on my next London visit. I chose this hotel as it was comparable with costs for the time we needed of hostels in London. We chose to pay only a few pounds more than a neighbouring hotel as the holiday inn offered breakfast.Check-in was efficient and friendly and we were acknowledged as new members straight away which was nice. Free late check out offered which was another lovely touch. The first morning down for breakfast I was shocked by how busy it was because it was so quiet in our room and we'd not been disturbed in the night. So many hotels you struggle with doors banging and being able to hear through rooms. I didn't find that here. The room was a generous size. Well appointed for a few nights too.Surprisingly I find there's too many little touches that made this hotel great to list... breakfast options & times, location, price, staff, rooms, shower, little member extras etc etc etc. Four minor gripes are...window didn't fully block out noise.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,ZAN1P0L0,Pleasantly surprised.,"Good marks to the staff at this hotel for allowing us to check in very early when the moronic security firm at the National Gallery refused to let us check in our cabin-sized case.  Evening meal and breakfast surprisingly acceptable - much better than the travelodge-standard offering I had expected.  Not far to walk from Stratford station, which is very well connected, being on the main railway as well as two underground lines and the DLR. The journey on the Jubilee is surprisingly quick, given how far out Stratford is.Room fine, though a loud hum from the building-site across the street on the east side was clearly audible despite the double glazing.The only really odd feature of our stay was that, for the first time ever in 40 years, our meal wasn't added to the room and paid for at check-out as in every other hotel I have stayed in.  I asked when ordering the meal to have it put on our bill.  We duly ate our food and retired to bed.  After i had been in bed for a hour or more, I was woken up by someone in reception wanting me to pay my 'bar bill' - so I ha do shove some clothes on and my shoes to go down and pay.I assume this to be some species of eccentric American hotel etiquette of which, never having stayed in any other US chain except a Best Western, I was quite unaware.  I don't blame the staff who, as I said at the outset, were all very polite and welcoming (though the majority of them appeared to be from Romania, which simply says something about the pay in the hospitality business).  But I assume they were acting on orders from above and terrified of the risk two old men in their 70's would skedaddle owing for two beers and two meals.  Incidentally, talking of beers: it wouldn't be a bad thing if the Holiday Inn people could bring themselves to stock proper beer instead of lager. Lager is not (yet) compulsory in the Common Market, and, indeed, we are on our way to escaping from it.  If they can't keep a draught beer, then let them be very brave and buy a crate or two of the hundreds and hundreds of craft beers being brewed by micro-breweries such as the East London Brewing Company of Lammas Road E10.All-in-all, though, I would stay here again if in the area.",February 2017,4.0,7,Traveled as a couple,-1,4.0,5.0,4.0,-1,-1

I noticed at the booking process that there was parking available for an extra fee.The hotel is located just shy of 10 minutes ( and felt like a lot less; even with an 8 year old in tow! ) from Stratford Station, pretty much a straight road, and you cant miss it when you reach the station, ( or the hotel - dependant on what form of transport you use to get theren).The hotel itself had lovely decor down stairs, with plenty of seating space, and the dining area where free breakfast was offered. I was welcomed with a smile and recognised as a member of the club they are connected to, and offered free wifi and complimentary late check out.. which I was very happy with - It's always nice to feel like a valued customer!I booked twin room for two nights. The guest room seemed bland in comparison to the lounge / reception area, but the room was clean, tidy, and had plenty of storage solutions (plenty of space to hang coats and store children's extra bits and bobs) and work space, (which was extremely useful for me to do coursework as well as office work!). I also noticed the hotel offered joining rooms at this point. The bathroom was clean, and made good use of the size. *Note For Review Purposes that you may not get a bath in your room.The only downsides I found were; - poor lighting in both the bathroom and guest room,- I could only find one plug socket.. which is not very useful when you need to charge a few things ready for the next day!- and it got really cold in the middle of the night.. which is not their problem so much as they do offer air con/ heating in room, but me trying to figure out the machine at 3AM without waking my son up is kind of hard to do.. Sometimes you have to clutch at straws for cons..I noticed the hotel offered a room for you to iron your clothes near the lift (on my floor), and a vending machine tucked away on the ground floor next to the lifts with a few basic necessities, drinks & snacks. The Breakfast is what you expect, and although I never considered to ask; (something I would normally do) I noticed no dairy alternatives on display, and I don't eat pork, so breakfast was limited, but there was enough variety for me to venture off course from my usual. * I mention for review purposes *Check Out was nearly quick and simple - a slight mishap, but the staff dealt with it efficiently and was more than happy to help - and a goodbye with a smile.I would recommend this hotel for families, business stays or weekends away with friends.

There was one little problem that we had where the staff tried to add on money for a dinner even though it was included in the package, but that was solved quickly. The rooms were average for a one night stay. Beds were comfy and the room was clean. Breakfast was delicious and had a wide range of things to eat and drink. Although it is on a busy road, you cannot hear the cars.

There are about 10 or so spaces at this hotel. I was booked to stay there for a week as I was working in the area but when I arrived the hotel car park was full, I called the hotel whilst waiting at the gates to the car park to ask if there was another car park or other parking aviliable and was advised to could try and park along the road (no spaces either) or I could go and park in Bingo which is approx a 5 minute walk away and would also cost £25 a night for that privilege too. This hotel needs to update their website and state there is limited parking. After approx half hour or so of my driving about trying to find somewhere close to the hotel I decided on cancelling my whole reservation but was then advised someone had left and a parking space was aviliable so luckily I could park overnight. However I did check out the next morning and am now in a different hotel with plenty of free parking spaces.I would like to say though the room was nice and clean and the staff were pleasant.

We were very early to breakfast so very few other guests were there - could be some waiting for toast and hot drinks at peak times I would imagine.To say there is a car park is a bit of an exaggeration. We arrived at  2.00 pm and it was full - it really is very small. On the upside the hotel is a ten minute walk from the massive and cheap Westfield car parks - we parked there for much less than the £20 per day at the hotel. Wouldn't be great in bad weather of course, and Stratford High Street is not the most desirable of areas, but we had no problems.

We were friendly greeted at arrival. For London standards the room size is ok. We had two adjacent rooms. A double and a twin. The DLR is closeby and takes you to Westfield where you can change for the underground. As we planned a lot on the Central line this was very convenient. There is a Tesco Express one block down. Unluckily there is no fridge in the room and no icemachine in the hotel.The drainage of our shower could have been better. The quality of our beds was good. They gave us a room at the back and we opened the room during the night and had no problem with noise. There is a rather big school on this backside of the hotel so probably during the schoolyear more risk of noise.The only real minus was the very strict policy on breakfast hours on monday. We arrived 9h25 at the buffet (which is meant to be open until 9h30, 10h30 during the weekend) and staff was already clearing out. We saw around 12 people arriving after us, so the need for longer hours is clearly pointed out by their guests. The staff even took something of the shelves in front of a small kid. Unbelievable. What I really cannot accept is that there were no croissants left in the buffet and some twenty minutes later we see a member of staff parading through the room with a croissant in her hands. They keep the restaurant really clean but that's real poor client service. The orange juice is not of good taste and the water has a chlorine taste. When you do not drink coffee you don't have good options.I parked my car in Westfield shopping where you pay 6,5£ for 24 hrs during the week and 9,5£ during the weekend. I found it convenient having to do the 15 minutes walk back to the hotel just to unwind after a long cardrive from Belgium.

It has a nice lobby and restaurant, clean and quiet rooms, ironing facilities and several other standard facilities (Wi-Fi, Led TVs, coffee / tea maker in rooms etc.) Access to location is very easy, from Stratford International or Central just keeping right on High Street (bus station remains on left) are around 5 minutes walking.  As street references, before Hotel on walking side there is a London College and a Travelodge office. On opposite side there is a red building named Poland House and face-to-face with Travelodge is an Olympic building. Hotel's entrance is on the cross with Carpenter's street on right side. Hotel has a contract with a cab (taxi) company so prices are sensible lowest (12-15 pounds vs. 22-25 pounds). Overall it is a 3 star hotel (an old building renewed) with small rooms without real closet (just an opened furniture), small bathrooms without any kind of special stuff. There is a parking place behind the hotel (exit from reception) for ~30 cars with 20 pounds per day. As well  there is a dedicated smoking area which is good if you'll like to drink your beers with a cigarette.If do not consider London prices, normally one night with breakfast to this hotel shall be not more than 50-80 Euro but for London a decent price may be 130-150 Euro.",June 2016,4.0,78,Traveled on business,-1,3.0,-1,5.0,3.0,-1

It's location is very good with a 2 minute walk from the DLR and 10 minutes to the stadium or Westfield shopping centre. Apart from the location, this hotel was disappointing and appeared to be poorly managed. We paid nearly £200 for our second night (the price was raised I presume because ACDC were playing at the stadium) breakfast on our first morning was a disaster. No where to sit, food running out and not being replaced and no one managing huge amounts of people. On the Sunday morning, 7.30 am, the cooked breakfast consisted of baked beans. The rest turned up 10 mins later. The bedroom was ok, but the bed was small and the handle on the window was broken. In the morning the toilets near reception, resembled a school disco.

The staff were fabulous, room was clean and tidy, breakfast was significantly better than expected, wi-fi worked and was free, housekeeping was good... Really difficult to find anything wrong with our stay! The only slight hiccup was the size of the car park - we were OK but I know some guests were turned away - but I guess that's expected in Central London.Overall, a great stay - highly recommended!",January 2016,5.0,668,Traveled on business,-1,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,5.0

The staff at breakfast were cheerful and polite.What was not so good was the complete lack of warmth and a welcome at check in. It isn't that difficult to make someone feel welcome and at the same time explain the basic facilities of the hotel. As an aside there was no recognition of the highest level of IHG loyalty.The other negative is the noise from outside. I was in a room that faced a side street and even with the window shut the traffic on the main street which appeared to be pretty constant throughout the night kept me awake.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,Christopher L,Very good value,"Booked HIEX Stratford as a last minute getaway hotel. We wanted somewhere with good access to Central London attractions and parking as this would work out cheaper than the train.The location was easy to find with Google Maps GPS. The parking was limited but still had a number of spaces - the majority of occupants seemed to have commuted via other means. This suited us as we wanted to leave the car at the hotel of the duration of our stay. It did say online that the parking was charged at £20 which was fine, but it wasn't clear that this was per night! As a result we had to pay £40 in total. An unpleasant surprise but still cheaper than the train (if we wanted to travel at a human time day).The room itself was what you'd expect and well presented. The shower was very good and the bathroom door was cleverly designed to double-up as both the main bathroom door and a toilet door when pulled fully open. Hard to explain but you'll see what I mean.The only quibbles would be the gap under the bedroom door lets through loads of light from the corridor so we blocked that. Also the vents for the windows can be adjusted to a closed position to reduce external noise. This does work but only to a degree. On the welcome letter it mentioned that HIEX would gladly supply you with bits you might have forgotten including earplugs to account for the regional noise (it's next to the Olympic Park). As the hotel is currently next to a building site, we requested earplugs but alas the main desk staff had no idea where they were or if they even had any.Breakfast was included though and there were certainly a good range of options including cooked and continental. Most importantly, the bed was very comfortable and restful with pillow options on hand.Would we stay here again?

The staff on reception were very friendly and I was impressed to be offered a free newspaper. The hotel did well to cater for marathon runners that weekend, providing a marathon buffet for £12pp which was perfect for us and opening breakfast early with plenty of cereal, toast and bananas, which I thought was a nice touch.  I wouldn't usually have chosen to eat at the hotel but if you want to, it has a nice area to sit with a widescreen TV and a decent enough bar. The hotel is ideally located for the Westfield shopping centre, being an easy 10 minute stroll and access to Central London is simple by hopping on the DLR which is nearby.

There was a strangely uncomfortable sofa in my room - my guess is that it is more directed at extending the number of beds than offering lounge-in-front-of-the-telly comfort to single travellers.  There is a basic, and rather frugal, supply of coffee/tea options, but I'm sure if I asked for extra, I would be given it.  The bed is firm, but there are no hollows in the springs, and the sheets are good quality and nicely smooth.  The pillows are unimpressive - they come labelled 'firm' and 'soft', but they feel universally unforgiving to me!  The whole gave me a decent night's sleep - I was a little warm, but not so much that I wanted to turn on the air-con, or open the window to the local traffic noise.The TV was basic, but better than you will find in many comparable hotels.The shower room is fine - large, walk-in shower that supplied plenty hot water in the morning.  Lots of towels, and the bath sheet was a good size - just a bit too abrasive!  I suspect it may not have been rinsed fully before drying, as tumble-drying is normally enough to get a towel fluffy, without any need for fabric conditioner.  The others were softer, so it may have been just one from a poor batch.Breakfast is free, and it's undoubtedly plentiful, if uninspiring, fare - hard scrambled eggs, beans and soggy but cooked through bacon, and a reasonable selection of 'continental' choices - but the small breakfast room can be a bit of a scrum when busy, and they don't provide trays!  I had to make three trips back and forth (the third to get the butter I'd forgotten) from my table, so by the time I settled down to eat, my 'hot' breakfast was pretty tepid.  They say they don't mind if you take your breakfast to your room, but I can't see how that might be practical.  But I'm quibbling, really - I left having slept well, breakfasted well, and the price I found on line was pretty reasonable, for a room within easy reach of central London.One last thought - the hotel is within easy reach of the large shopping mall in Stratford, where there is a variety of restaurant and fast-food options - I can't see why anyone would choose to eat in the hotel, as the prices look a bit eye-watering.Oh - and what really impressed was that they had found, and held on to, my phone charger from my visit the previous month.

First time staying at a Holiday Inn Express. Check in was quick and efficient. We were given a room on the 3rd floor. There was plenty of space to store clothes and the room was a good size and very clean. Only down side was that the bathroom smelt of smoke. Wasn't to bad at first but next morning the smell was quite strong. Was advised the staff were investigating this. We were moved to another room on the 6th floor. Don't think this was a family room. Room was smaller and when the sofa bed was pulled out the bottom of the sofa bed touched the back of the chair that was tucked under the desk. We had to climb over the sofa bed to get to the window. Not ideal but would rather put up with that than a room smelling of smoke. This room was also very clean. At the back of the hotel so very quiet. Breakfast was a busy time when we went down at 8.20am. Hot buffet was bacon,sausage,beans and scrambled egg. Considereing what we paid to stay here and that the breakfast was included I thought it was good. As previous review said never asked for room number and people were just helping themself to the toast, yoghurts, fruit etc and taking them out with them.

The only aspect that was poor was the breakfast buffet. Firstly, it was VERY busy and a free for all trying to fight your way to the food. At no point was I asked to prove I was actually staying in the hotel. Therefore, in theory, people could just come in for a free breakfast! Secondly, I noticed a very long black hair in the scrambled egg that had just been brought out. Not nice! Thirdly, I couldn't actually find anywhere to sit so had to take a seat at the bar. Credit to the member of staff who asked if I was okay sitting there and he did show me to a table as soon as one became available.So overall, a good hotel in a central location with helpful staff unfortunately let down by the breakfast.",February 2015,3.0,61,Traveled solo,-1,4.0,4.0,3.0,-1,-1

We stayed in many hotels and had vastly superior service and room quality for the same price. We arrived to the hotel at about 1 p.m. and as we were invited for a dinner somewhere else we just wanted to have a lunch in the hotel but the restaurant was not open for lunch only for dinner. I just wanted to iron my clothes but there is no iron in the room, I had to go to another floor to find a small room with iron and ironing board. I found it very inconvenient. No safe in the room. In the lobby you can find a locker and use it as your own safe but I do not think it`s a great idea. I was not very impressed with the breakfast either.

Price wise this was the most reasonable for location we required. All the usual facilities were there and of the usual standard and the staff were quite helpful. Stratford High St DLR is within 5 minutes flat walk away and the main Stratford station about 10 min. Parking I believe was being charged as a 'first come first served' £20 a day. It didn't sound too promising and hence we didn't take a chance. We certainly paid a ridiculous amount of money for the day but not a bad option on less busier days perhaps when the price will reflect its actual value which is 3 star.,December 2014,3.0,619,Traveled as a couple,-1,4.0,-1,3.0,4.0,-1

Then after calling twice and speaking to a male with a very strong French accent who did not understand what i was saying i was also put on hold and disconnected.When i did get through they refused to deliver said parcel down the road to the correct hotel.

We opened the window but this was very noisy. There were only 2 teabags on the hospitality tray which was a bit disappointing.Breakfast was very poor. Basically, it's served in the foyer of the hotel and it's chaos. The buffet is behind a wall at the back; you have to make your own hot drinks and fetch your own cutlery, as well as collecting the food so in a small space people are falling over each other. The pastries, fruit & cereal looked ok but the hot food was limited to microwaved scrambled eggs, sausage bacon and beans. No mushrooms, no tomatoes...not good news for a vegetarian. Another veggie issue was the yogurts, billed on the 'menu' as 'natural yoghurt', the yoghurt available was Muller Light which is not natural (full of sweeteners and preservatives) and contains pork gelatine, so unsuitable for vegetarians and anyone who doesn't eat pork.",November 2014,3.0,95,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The points would not even cover a cup of coffee!!  I was told that being as the breakfast was complimentary we had received value for money - I think not!

They have wifi included in the room rate, it's one of the reasons why I tend to book hotels in their chain. This place has a bizarre system that doesn't recognize your smartphone/pc etc, so you need to re-login all the time. Mightily annoying. The breakfast is included in the room rate, too. It's basic, but it does the trick. Given the rate I paid during my stay, I thought I paid way too much for what this establishment is. I ended up in a room with two small single beds. Terrible. They had soap spenders in the bathroom that basically disintegrated when you looked at them. The most pointless contraption I have ever seen. Location wise, well, I wanted to stay close to Stratford station for reasons to do with my travels. You can't beat this place, except perhaps for the better (and even more expensive at this time of the year) Holiday Inn at the Stratford Westfield shopping centre.

Although located on a busy road, I wasn't disturbed at all by traffic although I kept my room window closed.  The air conditioning in the room worked brilliantly.  The room was spotlessly clean, although a little dated, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Although no iron in the room, there was an ironing room on the same floor located by the lifts if required. The bathroom, although spotless, was showing signs of age and again was a little shabby - damaged tiles and chips on the basin surround, also there was only a shower and I prefer a bath, but that's my personal preference.  I didn't sample the breakfast here as service doesn't start until 6.30 and I had to be at a meeting before then, but the helpful receptionist did say that if required, the kitchen crew would be happy to provide cold options.  I did eat dinner in the restaurant and this is where my confusion began....... Firstly the ""restaurant"" consisted of chairs and tables in the main foyer of the hotel.  Food is ordered at the bar and you are then issued with a table number which you place on your table.  The choice was limited and I naively assumed that, as the website describes the restaurant as ""award winning"", the limited choice would be superbly cooked and well presented. How wrong I was.  I chose ""Posh Fish & Chips"" described as served with a crab cake, minted mushy peas and tartar sauce.  What arrived looked about as appetising as the  inner sole of my trainers.  I assume the chef had ""Gone to Iceland"".  I think the only thing on my plate that could be described as fresh would be the slice of lemon garnishing it.  The batter coating on both the fish and fish cake was dark brown and like biting into cardboard.  The fish cake left an unpleasant aftertaste but the fish was surprisingly succulent.  The chips were also good but not sure where the mint was in the minted mushy peas.  None of the waitresses asked if everything was ok with my meal (to be fair, it wasn't just me, no one else was asked either).  On the plus side, WiFi was free and was speedy in all areas of the hotel.  There is a car park adjacent to the hotel for customers only, but a word of warning - it's fairly small and is on a first come first served basis.  On the whole this hotel was good for my business needs, but I wouldn't choose to eat here again.  It's location is great for shopping and as a base for exploring London futher as it has good transport links.",October 2014,4.0,40,Traveled on business,3.0,-1,-1,4.0,-1,4.0

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,PMayes,"Average Holiday Inn Express, Good Staff","Stayed for four nights in July while visiting a physician in Canary Wharf.  The hotel is located about and 8 minute walk from the nearest train station.  It is not a dangerous area, but it's quiet and slightly isolated so if you plan on arriving late at night it might be worth getting a cab.The hotel itself is very clean and very nice.  The rooms are small (normal by standard English hotels, but small by American standards), a room with two beds means two twin (single) beds.  It was ideal from my Mother and I, but it's very close quarters if you aren't close to the person you are sharing with.  There is very little room for hanging clothing etc.The bathroom is tiny but well laid out and very functional.  There is an electric kettle and tea and coffee supplies in the rooms.  The whole room was spotless and the staff cleaned every day and were very friendly.The AC and heating works by inserting your room card in the slot when you enter.  While this is obviously environmentally friendly it does mean the room was VERY hot when you entered it in the Summer and you really had to wait for it to cool down.  I would assume the opposite is true in the Winter.  The room we were in was at the end of the corridor on the third floor and there was absolutely no noise to be heard at night.  We had an excellent night's sleep.Breakfast was excellent, well laid out and plentiful.  We ate the restaurant one night and considered the food expensive and average.  It was ok, but nothing to rave about.The hotel is about a 15 walk in Stratford itself and the nearby Mall (great shopping).  There are some good restaurants around the mall.  Another thing to note is there is another Holiday Inn Express located directly beside the Mall and nearer to the main Stratford train line (as opposed to the DCR line that this one is near).  This is a main hub train station so if access to public transport is main need for you then you should consider that hotel instead.The DCR train station that this is located near works well for London City Airport but Heathrow is a full 90 minutes with three train changes away (not fun with with suitcase - not all tube stations have elevators).

The bathroom is the same compact design as their hotel in Limehouse. Again small but sufficient. My only criticism is that there is a metal shower tray which is quite slippery when wet - a shower mat would be helpful to avoid slips. The beds are firm to the point of being a bit uncomfortable. The room had air conditioning which helped cool the room down. Our room was facing away from the road so rather than leaving the air con running overnight we opened the window. There was a bit of noise from the air con plant but it was okay.The breakfast selection was okay but the cooked option of sausages (okay), scrambled egg (a bit watery and lacking flavour) and baked beans was a bit limited.Checkout was again speedy and pleasant.We tried to walk to the Olympic Park for a walk but the route isn't obvious and we ended up driving to Westfield to park.

The small TV 'hangs' on the wall, you cant straighten it and you cant really turn it to view so the only real option is to sit on the bed and watch it!The shower is large enough (1.5 size?) and powerful enough although I had an issue with drainage so the tray filled with water. I reported this to reception and the problem was fixed when I arrived back later that day, so no complaints there... other than surely this could be checked by the cleaning team? There was a lingering 'drain' smell after this issue that didnt go away whilst I stayed, surely again the cleaning team could address this?!Breakfast is a very UNDERWHELMING affair! I know it is 'Free' but seriously, all aspects of it are poor and quality is economical in my view!The scrambled egg was anaemic, the sausages poor quality, the beans were clearly cheap catering beans.. so I opted for toast... the bread was thin and poor quality.

I chose bananas, they were fine!Dont even bother with the wifi, its poor, slow and intermittent.The best part about this hotel is the friendly and helpful staff.

Free breakfast and wifi was a plus. The hotel staff were nice generally but it depends on who is on shift. I stayed for 6 nights and throughout my stay, I was fortunate enough to get nice staff who were helpful. Though there was no room service, they kindly allowed us to order takeaways and even loaned us their meeting room for a brief while as I had some work matters to settle.Though it was at the east end, there was a Tesco express less than 5 mins away and the huge Westfield shopping just 10 minutes away.Perhaps the only downside was the distance to central London. Taking the tube was fasr, but if u were taking a cab or a mini bus(privately engaged) it would take an hour at least to reach central London because of the jam.I didn't travel with young children so the basic amenities were sufficient for adult and teens. However, if u are travelling with young children, I am not sure how child friendly it would be.Also, there were only 2 lifts.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,Craig & Rhonda,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here for one night for a trip to London. If you book here you really have nothing to worry about, the hotel is lovely, and the rooms clean with comfortable beds and a very powerful shower.  I had a room on the top floor and the view overlooks the Olympic Park.  The surrounding area seems really nice and it is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest bus/train/tube station and about 15 mins on the tube into the centre of London.  There are only a couple of reasons why I have given a rating of 4 and not 5. The parking is a little expensive (£20 for 24 hours). I know this is London and parking spaces are at a premium but it just seems a little excessive.  The hotel is quite large (6 floors) and there are only 16 parking spaces, but I went on a Bank Holiday weekend and it wasnt full, so if you are driving, I am sure you would be ok - it is also very secure.  The second reason, and to be honest I am being overly picky, was there was no bacon for breakfast. There was however plenty of choice, the hot breakfast being sausage, egg and beans, with plenty of cereals, toast, muffiins etc. The question I always ask myself when doing these reviews is would I stay there again.  The answer for this hotel is definitely yes, it is one of the nicer ones I have stayed in in London.",May 2014,4.0,44,Traveled as a couple,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

My only complaint is the lighting, a lot of modern hotels do not have adequate lighting over mirrors and the lighting is generally dim and Hotel Inn Express is no exception, hotels need to realise women need good lighting for applying make up etc. The breakfast was as expected, typical buffet style but it was slightly manic at the time we ate, guests are warned of the busiest periods so we could only blame ourselves.

Beds are comfy and got a nice full nights sleep. The breakfast on both mornings was good, it was busy in the restaurant though and had to wait for a table the one morning. The choice is cereal, yogurts and fruit, bread, croissants, sausage, scrambled eggs and beans. Both mornings there was no sausage but within minutes it was filled back up. We had drinks in the hotel bar on an evening when we got back which was around 12am and it was nice and chilled out. To get to London we used the tube. The walk to the tube was around 7-10 minutes. There is also a DLR closer and the train station is with the tube, so lot's of ways to get into London. We paid aprox £8 each for a day tripper which got us around and about London and to the hotel which is in Zone 3. It was around 7-9 stops into the main parts of London depending where you are going. There is a big Westfield where the tube/train station is so if you fancy shopping this is ideal. The hotel is also by the Olympic stadium. We ventured into Stratford high street on the one evening and regretted this more or less instantly, we all felt uncomfortable with the gangs and the people hanging around. We walked in a bar and walked back out because it looked quite rough.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,Maya-Rony F,Just what you need for a short stay..,"Stayed here for 6 nights with my husband. The location is very quiet, with a market just across the street and very close to a big shopping center called Westfield. The fact that it's not located in the center of London is no problem at all. You can easily  use the underground station which is a 10 min walk from the hotel, and it can take you there with a maximum time of 30min. Using the tubes is very easy.  You can get an Oyster card directly from the airport, it will make your stay easier. It was a very good stay. The room was comfortable and very clean, with a small TV, tea and coffee facilities, as well as a hair dryer. But we had a minor issue with the shower 's plumbing and the lack of q-tips.Staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was so British  but with limited options and it was the same every day. The most annoying is that if you come a little later than 8 you can't find a place to sit. The buffet room is also tiny. But a positive point is that you have access to an unlimited supply of hot drinks such as tea, hot chocolate, cappuccino, or other.Apart from that, it s a very good hotel with a good value for money and free wifi. I would highly recommend it for anyone who s not looking for a romantic or a fancy stay.",January 2014,4.0,109,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The buffet is set up in a really tiny room at the end of a small restaurant. There are not enough seats so you often have to wait to sit down and once you have, you have to struggle through the rest of the people trying to get into the tiny room at the end of the restaurant where the buffet is located.

I can reassure anybody who is going to see a concert in the O2 this hotel is perfect. It is less than 10 minutes on the tube to Northern Greenwich which is where the O2 is located. It is on the opposite side of the city so you wont be waiting for ages to get on the crowded tube when concerts are on. The Inn itself is lovely, clean, comfortable and the staff are very friendly. There is FREE wifi in the Inn which was a brilliant bonus because most places charge you.The breakfast is FREE, which is a great bonus and you also get the choice of a continental or hot breakfast. I don't know of any other place I have stayed that would offer you a free hot breakfast. Ok its not the full Irish but a breakfast is a breakfast and it fills you until lunch what more could you ask for. The rooms were clean and tidy, ok they are basic but a hotel room is a hotel room all you want is a nice comfy bed, a warm room and a hot shower and this place has all of that.To get to the Holiday Inn is very easy you can go on the central or jubilee line directly to Stratford. If coming from Gatwick Airport like I was the train takes 20-25 mins to London Bridge and there you switch to the Jubilee line and it takes another 20-25 mins to get to Stratford and the Inn is a 5 min walk around the corner.There is a massive shopping centre 5 min walk from the Inn, beside the tube station which was a massive bonus for me I love shopping :) Im guessing over 200 shops I couldn't go around to them all I didn't have the time, but all the big names you would expect to see in any shopping centre. Loads of choices for different meals everything you would want under one roof.This Inn was perfect and as it was our first trip to London we didn't have a clue where anything was.

The room was fine and after I left my card in the slot one morning and went for breakfast I returned and the maid was happy to let me back in the room.There are a few fast food vendors near the Stratford Station which were still open around midnight on the Sunday i.e McDonalds, K.F.C and across the road a chippy / kebab house for if you return late from a show e.t.c e.t.c",September 2013,3.0,33,Traveled with friends,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Recognising that this will have been the first time that the hotel was full of cyclists and bikes the did a great job.  Opening up for breakfast at 5am was very much appreciated.  I thought the food was fine and there was plenty of it.  But, the noise in our room from the road was relentless.  It's a main road into London and was busy all night. I didn't get much sleep.Get a room on the other side of the hotel unless you are a really heavy sleeper.I have to say that the staff were super friendly and helpful - much appreciated.As this looks set to be an annual event they do need to think about bike storage.  We kept ours in our room and that was great (as everyone else seemed to be).  But if they had been wet the hotel would have ended up with a few oil stains here and there however careful people tried to be.  Maybe provide super size bin liners to cover rear wheel and drivetrain and insist people use them?In summary - fine for the price.

What they'd do if all the bikes were soaked and oily after bad weather, I haven't a clue!). Bedroom bike storage is very handy for pre-ride bike prep. It was obvious the staff were taken aback by the 20,000-strong field, and the place suffered as it tried to cope with an overwhelming tide of cyclists.I asked for a quite room and didn't get one: the traffic noise from Stratford Hight Street was truly awful, and 3hrs kip before a 100-mile ride ain't good. Second night after a severe complaint, we were moved to a much nicer room in the newly-built extension at the back, and slept OK.The staff were really good, and did their best, but even the kitchen was overwhelmed by the amount of food that hungry cyclists need to consume, and closed early.

The internet is a surcharge, and the rooms are unbelievably small. However, they are very clean and modern. Also - they only provide a dual-acting shampoo/body wash in the showers, so if you want better toiletries, I suggest you bring your own. Breakfast was great, with a lot of selection.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,DemetraMontreal,A pleasant surprise.,"The Hotel Staff: These people worked very hard to accommodate us, and always had a smile to offer, a helping hand where needed. A huge thank you to everyone who made us feel so welcome in London.On booking this Hotel we already knew it wasn't a 4 star with greatviews, rooms and facilities, and were fully aware that others travelingto our congress were at much more plush Hotels in the London area. Wehad read up on various sites about the Holiday Inn Express in Stratford, some had painted a rather rough picture for anyone wanting to stay there, so we were prepared for any eventualities.On entering the Hotel, alarge front desk greeted us, and everyone was exceedingly friendly.Something we were again not prepared for. The Weather was shocking, highwinds, rain, and it was desperately cold too, we were too. A wheel hadbroken on one of our suitcases, and this had to be dragged almost to thefront door, so it was with delight we were greeted by such friendlypeople. Without any fuss, our room keys were issued, we got two. ManyHotels are starting a regime of onlyhanding out one key, which we find totally unacceptable, and realizethis is to cut down on electricity costs, again another plus for this hotel.Our Room:The elevator taken, we arrived at our room, opened the door and waited....It wasn't plush, it was a good size however. We had asked for a roomwith a view of the Olympic stadium, what we got however was a wall. ***** We had no firdgeThat didn't really bother us, we were looking to stop traffic noise at nightwhich we had heard about from reading other reviews. The Traffic noise,such as it is, isn't that bad at all. Yes it is on a main thoroughfarethrough Stratford, but it wasn't that bad, even in the rain.Our room showed signs of wear almost everywhere, but the bed was clean, andthoroughly comfortable when sleeping, again another plus. The one thingwe would add here is that the room was very cold. We were never surethat the Thermometer actually worked having asked about it. We'd triedadjusting it several times, to no avail. A window seal was not tight and wind came in, even ifslightly, but that made a difference without any real heating, on such ablustery and very cold and rainy stay.The Bathroom:The above said, it wasn't by any means a bad room for the money paid, agood bang for your buck frankly, but the bathroom was a differentmatter.There was no toilet brush, no bar of soap, no hand towels, no hair hat for the shower, only an all-purpose liquid. The only asset the Bathroomsported was 4 towels and two hand cleansers, one of which was broken, the piece lying by the sink.The sink leaked a little, and it was frankly cold in there too. Thankfully the air flow for reducingcondensation wasn't working, we feel that this would have made it evencolder. Overall on the Bathroom except for the very hot water which was ablessing in disguise, we weren't very impressed.Rooms are made up in the afternoon, which we found strange. We thought they mayhave forgotten us, but that all became clear when we were in the roomlater and a gentle knock at the door signaled the cleaning lady.Breakfast:We had read there was NO bacon, but that wasn't any real issue. Sausages /Beans / Scrambled Egg were the order of the day, plus two breadtoasters and the usual fruits and cereals on display. I found itparticularly odd that there were no tomatoes or ham on the menu. Noteveryone wants sausages and beans. Certainly my better half didn't eatowing to this because of dietary issues, everything contained fat orsugar, except some yogurt.....Coffee was great however.....On the last day, a Sunday, we came down as usual for our breakfast, andthere was nothing there. (Picture included). This was from 6.30 to 7.00 am on that Sunday. We had agrinding day of travel ahead of us, a broken suitcase, and many milesto travel in subways, with no real breakfast.... I made do with 4 slicesof toast, my better half had just coffee and yogurt. It wasn't the best start.Overall:Would we stay there again? Absolutely. It wouldn't take much to repair someviews we had of the Holiday Inn Express of Stratford, if we needed theEXCEL conference center again.Travel times were drastically reduced,owing to the location, it was easy and super quick to get there and backvia the DLR which is basically across the road about 1000 feet. Themain Stratford station is about 10 minutes walk, people are exceedinglyfriendly everywhere, if you need anything, ask anyone, just abouteveryone will help, at least that is what we found. The General location:***** NOTE: When going to the Holiday Inn Express in Stratford, make sure thatyou go to 'Stratford High Street' Station, this will save you a small hikefrom Stratford Central...Clean streets spawn a multicultural populous with no distinctions that wesaw. A great and formidably low priced Shopping center towards Stratfordstation, and a huge Shopping complex just above it. You could if youwanted purchase, just about anything while there.Cockneys on the Trains, both drivers and guards made any journey a fun one, even if delayed at times. 2, 8 foottall policemen who pointed out a pub to us made one day in Londontotally unforgettable, they must breed these people somewhere! A must:Covent Garden... We saw a wonderful opera singer there at the 'Crusting Pipe'.a coffee/food house located inside, well worth a visit if you havemusical tastes. We missed out on Don Carlos at the Royal Opera House,but were very happy to read a nonplussed review of it while waiting forour last plane that day. So we didn't miss anything from what we saw. Wealso didn't miss the 193 steps to get to Covent Garden via the subway,we took the lift!Except for the torrid weather - Unforgettable.",May 2013,4.0,27,Traveled on business,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

The bus stopped outside Stratford train station and as we passed the hotel before we reached stratford station we knew which direction to walk when we got off. On arrival at the hotel. We checked in with ease. The reception staff were great very helpful and willing to offer advice and information. As there were two of us, we booked a twin room . The room was fine a little on the small side but fine. Crisp, clean white sheets the only thing missing was the number of towels could have done with another bath towel.  The next morning this was rectified as I meet a nice girl from housekeeping who obligied me with the additional towel.

This shopping mall really has everything you need: supermarkets, shops, restaurants, food courts, cinema, bowling alley, etc. At times you just want to stay close to the hotel to grab a bite and there were plenty of choices right outside our door. Yes, you have to travel a bit to reach London's city centre, but it really wasn't a problem for us. Stratford station is a 3 minute stroll from the hotel and it takes about 20 minutes to get to the Houses of Parliament (Westminster station), so not bad at all.The hotel itself is really good. We got upgraded to an executive room which was really spacious. The room is clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the 2 bottles of complimentary water and the chocolate bar that you receive every day. Also, the fridge is empty, so you can get some groceries and stock them up in your fridge.If I'd ever go back to London I would definitely go back here and I would recommend my dear ones to do so too.",May 2013,5.0,136,Traveled as a couple,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

It is a very comfortable hotel and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone reading this review. Where to begin from, the staff at the reception desk and the house-keeping is very friendly and helpful, the check-in is quick and easy, the lobby and the corridors are neat, the lift is located nearby, the rooms are just the right size..not too big and not too tiny. In the room, apart from the regulars, there is a coffee/tea kettle with supplies, a huge study desk and chair, a full length wall mirror, hanging rod, hair dryer. The bathrooms are good. This may be of importance to a few choosy ones like me, that the bathroom is well lit, shower pressure is really good, and the bathing area has many shelves to keep stuff, but there is no wardrobe in the room. Breakfast spread is quite good. But the items remains the same everyday.Since this is HI ""Express""..so, ofcourse, there is no room service, or fridge in the room or gym.The hotel is located at half min walk from bus stop, 1 min walk from Tesco and some restaurants, 8 mins walk from Stratford Bus Station and Stratford Underground Station.

The hotel itself has been spruced up for the Olympics and is very smart with very helpful staff.  The area is a bit of a desert in terms of restaurants and facilities - the HI Express provides an excellent complimentary breakfast.  The rooms are very well organised and smart with a great bathroom with modern fixtures.My only average rating reflects the most important element of a stay, the bed.  We stayed two nights, and I'm very glad it was only for two and no more.  We discovered during our first night, that the bed was ridiculously soft and bouncy.  This meant that my partner and I both suffered badly from aching backs, and also that the slightest movement by either of us could result in the other person being catapulted on to the floor.  Talking of floors, the boxspring and/or mattress were so bad that we ended up moving the mattress and sleeping on the floor.Following calls to the front desk, we discovered that the hotel didn't have any form of board for the bed, and that apparently this 'newer' mattress was the standard for the IHG chain.  Now I'm no real expert but I don't recall waking up and feeling like Herman Munster after sleeping in any North American establishment within the IHG group. After much pleading the following morning, we toured the hotel trying to find a better mattress for the second night, and ended up in another room with something slightly more acceptable. I have to say the staff couldn't have been more helpful.This is an enormous shame as I really liked this hotel and the great staff who work there.  I wouldn't stay here again because of the likelihood of having to endure a night on a rack.",October 2012,3.0,250,Traveled as a couple,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0

Two self service hot drinks machines and plenty of seats/tables available. The fruit juice didn't taste watered down either - bonus!Main gripe - the bed! As other reviewers have mentioned it is very low and the mattress is waaaay too soft - come on Intercontinental you can do better than this! Also I could not tell the difference between the 'firm' and the 'soft' pillow either!Plus points - its about a 6/7 minute walk from Stratford tube station. You can get to central London (Holborn station) from Stratford tube station in 15 minutes. Stratford is not as far from the centre of London as it looks on the tube map. Top Tip - when arriving at Stratford tube station to get to the Hotel follow the exit signs for Stratford town centre NOT the Westfield Mall (unless you want to go straight to the Mall of course! PS its an amazing Mall if you like that kind of thing). There is another Holiday Inn (Staybridge Suites) right in the Mall so don't confuse this hotel with that one!Turn right at the bus station as you exit the tube station to get to the hotel. There is currently some construction taking place here (Nov 2012) so just follow the diversion signs to the right.

Which they did, no problem.Our room was very nice and clean, with white bedding, choice of pillows and with large towels. Good hot shower too and toiletries supplied free of charge from reception if you should forget to bring anything.Not much room to put any clothes away, but I don't suppose guests stay long enough for that anyway.Our mistake was not asking for a room away from the High Street. The noise of traffic and emergency services was all through the night.  To be expected I'm sure on a busy London street.The free breakfast was to be praised.

The hotel itself was clean and modern and the rooms pleasant, but this is where the pleasantries end. There are only two lifts for the whole building, one of which was out of order and had been for some time. The staff seemed in no hurry to remedy the situation when questioned, much to the annoyance of many of the guests. This meant that everyone checking out at 11am were waiting on the one lift. We reported the air conditioning in our room did not cool the room down, it only blew out heat. The staff replied that they had changed the settings in readiness for winter and that all the air con units were linked therefore this could not be changed. This meant the hotel was horribly hot all the time. It would be easy to suggest to open the windows, but as the hotel is directly situated next to a busy road this made sleeping almost impossible. We had to borrow a fan from reception. The food at the restaurant was also a sore point. My wife has an allergy to cheese, she ordered a salad which had no cheese on the menu. It came covered in it. We complained and the waiter explained it might take a few minutes to make a fresh dish. After 30 minutes we gave in and asked for a refund. My wife then ordered tea and biscuits, the biscuits were a month out of date. When we took them back the staff seemed to find it amusing and offered no apology just simply replaced them. Having returned from NY last week and saw how the Americans do hospitality this hotel was an embarrassment, made worse by the fact that the hotel had many Americans staying there. The staff in general had no inclination to make anyone's life more comfortable. When people (and there were plenty) complained they seemed to listen, brush it off and do nothing about it.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,Lars R,"A well-situated, well-kept hotel within reach","Our family stayed for a week in October, and were very pleased with what we got. As both games (Olympic and Paralympic) were already over, there was no rush and no construction work, thus accessibility was excellent as well. The hotel is well situated as it is just a short walk from a DLR station (Stratford High Street) and within a 10min walking range of the Stratford main tube station (Jubilee and Central) as well the massive Westfield mall worth visiting. Trips to the city centre didn't take long so Stratford was also easy to reach. Lots of convenience stores just a few steps away.All staff were very friendly and helpful. We immediately felt at peace when we checked in and got to our double bed + sofabed room. The sofabed however, which had been made in anticipation of our 2,5yr old son, was so high that we couldn't have slept peacefully knowing the kid could fall while sleeping, so we collapsed the sofa and laid the mattress down on the floor. A separate children's bed would have been more proper but we didn't have the choice of choosing one when booking through our travel agency, I don't even know if they have children's beds, but this was just a minor issue. The double bed was far too soft for my back (having got adjusted to a futon) but again, that's just a personal preference. Things that we did feel strange about were the door to the adjacent room, the strange tap on the bathroom sink and the rather high pricing on wifi access.The door, I would imagine, is useful if you are two families or a bunch of friends traveling and want to share rooms, but otherwise I couldn't think of a reason to put us there. Noise was emanating from the other room each morning and night, and was a bit disturbing to hear what others were talking about. I can imagine the guests in the other room were also disturbed to hear our talk and the cry of our baby..The sink tap was really weird - it drizzled/sprinkled/sprayed water in a shower sort of fashion as opposed to a regular water stream in all the rest of the world. I would imagine the taps have been made so to spare on conserve water, but it sure made washing hands really frustrated as the sink area was wet all over after just washing hands. I asked about this from the cleaning maids but was told all taps are like this and there's nothing they can do about it.Otherwise.. our room was very clean and cozy, with most amenities you needed - a water kettle, instant coffee and tea, a TV and so on. We felt very good staying there. Wifi access was made too expensive. Most european hotels these days (it's 2012 after all) give either free wifi access or a 24-hour access card for a few coins, but here you got 30mins for a few pounds (can't remember how much but several pounds anyhow) which I feel is expensive, and the 24-hour card was also very expensive. Breakfast was the usual continental fare, though without oatmeal/porridge or any salad, but a good one none the less. Food could be taken back to the room (since our kid was sleeping and didn't wake up for breakfast) which was nice.A highlight was, however, when our son got thrilled by a maid servicing the breakfast (and our room for a day or two), who gave cookies and played peekaboo with our son, so that was really great - she even said she'll miss us when we had to leave :(Just the small details I pointed out earlier would have made this visit perfect, but even now this was a very good visit which after all left us smiling when we left, so I'd return any day if I were out and about :)",October 2012,4.0,74,Traveled with family,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

The shower cubicle was large and very clean, the shower was hot and fairly strong which is good.  One thing that I would comment on is that the shower floor was quite slippy, not an issue for me but could be a safety issue for someone who is elderly or is infirm.  The breakfast was the let down for my stay.  The hotel was full so the bar/breakfast area was quite cramped.  I really don't like the 'bench' arrangement of the tables but can understand why it is necessary.  The breakfast itself was a huge disappointment, the sausages were strange, why not just provide 'regular' sausages which will appeal to a wider audience.  There was scrambled egg and beans, both of which I don't eat and bacon which was covered in the white 'scum' that you get on cheaper bacons.  To be fair it tasted okay but wasn't hot despite being kept under lights.  The buffet part of the breakfast was limited so I ended up with just toast and fruit; I like to have a full breakfast when I'm on business as I often can't get a proper lunch.Checkout was easy and quick and again the staff were excellent.I would certainly recommend the hotel but, given the choice, would go elsewhere for breakfast.",September 2012,4.0,37,Traveled on business,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

Our room 427 overlooked a courtyard at the back of the hotel and was nice and quiet. We did not notice any noise from the traffic which is always a bonus in London. The bed was soft but comfortable and the water in the bathroom was hot and plentiful. We did not use the WiFi because 3G coverage was pretty good in our room on the O2 network. There was an additional charge for using WiFi. We also noticed that our floor had an ironing room which we did not use. There was also tea/coffee making facilities in the room.Breakfast was complimentary and served until 10:30. The selection and quality was fine for a quick breakfast with hot food available on the buffet counter.The reception desk employees were polite and helpful at both check-in and check-out.We really could not find fault with the hotel, other than it was a little pricey because of the Paralympics but I am sure you get a better rate at other times of the year.

We stayed one night during the period of the Paralympic Games, as it is adjacent to the Olympics site in Stratford (London).Firstly, the staff were very helpful and pleasant; the room was clean, just as it should be.However, the rate was £256 ($400) for the two of us for one night b&b through their own website (normally c.£76-$120/night). Clearly some profit-taking was going on for the period of the Paralympic Games. For comparison, when we stayed at a hotel in Weymouth for the Olympic sailing events, the hotel rate was unchanged, in spite of heavy demand. For that price we had one bath towel between the two of us (maybe they were so busy the supply had run out). Noisy aircon, but it could be switched off. In addition, we ordered a very standard dinner about 7.00pm with no-one in front of us; only one family had already had their meal delivered. It took around 40 minutes for ours to arrive. Maybe the Chef had run out of fish, but the load on the kitchen seemed to be virtually non-existent.In the morning at breakfast the place was full of visitors, volunteers, media and officials for the Olympics – the breakfast buffet was fine, with a good choice.So there were mixed feelings about our stay. I hope the issues we experienced were just because of the Olympic Games. However, for the price, we did feel we should have had gold-medal treatment. Incidentally there is a good Tesco Express convenience store near to the hotel – turn right out of the front door and walk along the road c. 200 yards, and across a road junction, to find it.",September 2012,3.0,95,Traveled as a couple,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,the_vostok,Good...but could have been better.,"We had to make a last minute dash to London and stay on the East side, so this seemed like an ideal location. In actual fact the hotel is located near not much really - I guess you could say that the Olympic Park is near, as is the Westfield shopping mall, but thats about it from what I could see. It's probably a 10 minute walk fron the DLR railway station which you will need to visit anywhere in the Capital.However, this is a clean, well presented hotel with courteous staff. Everything is sort of 'compact' and it had the smallest family room that we've ever stayed in, but it was clean and in good order. The beds were a joke - as soft as a sponge, the type where you roll into the middle, but did have a selection of pillows of different density. The aircon didn't seem to make any difference, it just whirled away.At time of booking and at check-in we specifically asked for a quiet room because we had a very busy couple of days. We were allocated a room on the first floor at the rear of the hotel and everything seemed fine....until 2.15am when we were woken by some noisy builders on a tea/smoke break. A call to reception eventually got them moving, that was until 3.00am when they had another break. A further irate call to reception was needed. As you can imaging, with an early start we were really tired in the morning. The front desk were apologetic but this shouldn't have been allowed to happen in the first instance.Breakfast was a self-service continental affair but it wasn't obvious if the cooked items were also included or were extra.So there we have it - the hotel was OK but let down for us by some small problems that shouldn't have happened.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,Clashist,Mainly good - Top Floor is SMOKING,"Agents will tell you it is against the law for hotels to provide smoking rooms in London - DO NOT BELIEVE THEM. The fact is that the majority of the world are still smokers and in major international destinations like London the chains simply cannot afford to alienate the majority of their customers in this way. Besides this major point, this hotel was everything you would expect from a new build, Holiday Inn Express so I will concentrate on the few drawbacks we experienced....The cab company they use when you ask for them to call you a car often uses drivers who don't know simple destinations such as 'The Science/Natural History Museum'. Find a local 'hire car' company and ask for a business card then ring them directly yourself rather than ask at reception. Many in the area are both cheap AND excellent.The air conditioning was pretty poor and opening the window to let in cooler air at night meant all the noises from a very busy four lane high street outside (a main route for emergency vehicles with sirens blaring) were also let in.The staff were all willing to be helpful and all requests were met with a smile .... just that some of the staff weren't that great at actually doing what was required ... like providing ice in a bucket for the room, for example.Despite it being only around 9am one of the cleaners (I presume) let themselves into the room without knocking - a simple precaution when entering a hotel room well before checkout time (11 am checkout time by the way - too early, 12:00 would be better, but helpful when asked to keep baggage safe until 2pm)  and causing embarrassment to all concerned.No bath in this room, just a smallish shower with curtain and water temperature that varied from very cold to scalding hot without touching the controls!Although supposedly a budget hotel (granted, at the high end of budget hotels) and booked a month in advance the price was too high for a hotel so far from London centre though this was almost certainly because it is on the doorstep of the new Olympic stadium. Using the overground and underground to get into London proper with a day pass takes about 30-45 minutes at a cost of around ten quid but allow another 20 minutes for the queues to buy tickets at the machines as while we were there 25 - 50% of them had ceased to function by 9am.Last buy not least - the bed in this particular room was WAY too soft.

This is a fairly new hotel, so you are unlikely to notice any part that seems 'run-down'. I liked 3 things about the HIE-Stratford, and have only 1 suggestion for improvement.As a budget hotel, they run their operations with a limited/skeletal staff, and so at times one might have to wait or actually search for the relevant staff-member! If you happen to be checking in our out at an odd hour (like, say 4.30am) then dont be surprised to see a deserted front desk. Similarly, you may want to ensure that you have the time/patience if thinking of ordering a meal from their menu -- it does take time!What still makes this hotel stand out is (a) a very friendly and helpful staff, (b) superb location, and (c) all this at a fairly reasonable price, given that we are talking about London!The HIE-Stratford is located about 7-8 minutes walking distance from the Stratford tube (underground) station, so you are well-connected with the City (a few stations away). Right next to the station, but after exiting on the other side (Westfield Stratford), are multiple shopping malls as well as the 2012 Olympic arena. Those interested in getting a view of the O2 Arena should go to the top floor of John Lewis - it has a viewing deck with binoculars!To get to the HIE, once you reach Stratford tube station, come out of the exit that says 'Stratford Centre' (the other side exit goes toward 'Westfield Stratford'), turn right (you will walk by an old steam engine called 'Robert') till, in about a minute, you reach what looks like a T-junction and a busier road (this is the High Street). Take a right and keep walking. You will see a white-and-red building on the opposite side ('Poland House') and a small white building declaring itself to be a part of the Univ of East London (called 'Duncan House') on your side of the road, and shortly thereafter you will cross Travelodge. The next building on your side of the street will be the HIE.I had an enjoyable stay at the HIE Stratford and may stay again!",June 2012,4.0,101,Traveled on business,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

I stayed in a room with two single beds at the back of the hotel - quieter, I suspect than the front which faces a main road.  I was woken once or twice by noises from outside - bottles being moved and that kind of thing.  The room was on the first floor, so noises filtered up from the bar as well.The room was £175 for the night.  This included breakfast and free internet access.  Hugely expensive, of course, but beggars cannot be choosers in London and I did book relatively late.  The Olympics were only three weeks away, so maybe that explains why the rate was so high.

When you laid down, your body had the form of a U. It also felt like a waterbed - if you moved your leg, the whole bed started wobbling. It did not really help to find out that it was not really a bed, but more of an extracted couch with a (soft) mattress on it. The (other) couch in the room looked exactly the same, just not extracted and with no mattress on it.When we asked the very friendly staff to get a harder mattress or at least another room, they said all the mattresses were the same in every room (they did not have an extra mattress) and that they unfortunately could not do anything about it (but she said there were many complaints about these soft mattresses and that the hotel was already looking for harder ones).The included breakfast buffet was good (though it almost did not have any fruits), mostly because of the cappuccino machine and the freshly squeezed orange juice machine.Overall it was a very clean hotel with a friendly staff but - if you spend the whole day on your feet walking through London, it is better to find a hotel where you sleep well and not wake yourself up constantly by moving just a leg or an arm.",June 2012,3.0,1,Traveled with family,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0

My room last month had a hole in the bathroom door which was about fist sized, and various fittings are failing in the rooms.This one has a tv stand that was canted over and loose - thought if I moved it would fall.Having smapled several rooms now there is a pattern of poor maintenance here.The aircon was ineffectual during out one week heat wave too, this was reported but not fixed.Room service standards are extremely good and the team always jovial and friendly to guests.But where this business fails consistently is the quality of its food and service.You will pay more than any top restaurant chain in the nearby Westfield. A lot more.And the service is dire, expect to wait no less than thirty minutes, every time for poorly cooked and fairly 'synthetic' meal akin to any night in a Wetherspoon pub.Nothing wrong with Wetherspoon either, I love a budget pub, but contrast a pint and a curry there against the same food, smaller portions and served more slowly for three times the cost?Breakfast in 'free' only becuase you simply couldn't charge for it. I always forgo it and head to a nice private cafe nearby.It's surprising you can still get away with poor quality like this in 2012.The headline room rates now it's getting ever nearer to games time are astonishing (very high).I'm afraid this will be one of a few hotels that won't go the distance in Stratford once 2012 is a distant memory.The are juts a few parking slots, an nothing nearby. There are no alternative eateries in the vacinity.The hotel has no additional facilities at all.With better franchises less than a mile away, and an excellent Premiere Inn right beside the best food in town, why bother coming here at all?Previous reviews are interesting, and many from infrequent visitors to London.Which is possibly why they are happy to rate mediocre quite highly.",June 2012,2.0,25,Traveled on business,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,pchristi,Location is key,"Look, first of all this is a Holiday Inn Express, it's not a five star stay, bear this in mind when booking. I have looked at some of the other reviews, I cannot comment on the competence of the staff in general beyond checking in and checking out, this they achieved with no problem.I found the room to be quite comfortable, I was concerened about the room being at the front and overlooking Stratford High Street, I shouldn't have as the noise level was not a problem at all. The bed was comfy enough for an undisturbed sleep. I didn't spend a whole heap of time in the room beyond sleeping, but I would have been happy enough to.Breakfast was, well Express style breakfast - scrambled eggs, suasages, beans, a variety of pastries and croissants, cereals, fruit, yoghurt. Let's face it, for an included in the price breakfast it did the trick.But the overwhelming advantage of this hotel is it's location. Putting ther Olympic statdiium to one side for the moment; those who are not really familiar with London geography should note that Stratford is convinently on the Jubilee and Central tube lines, Overground rail services and the Docklands light railway. Liverpool Street and therefore the central business district is one stop by overground and a couple of stops by tube. In a nutshell, a brief journey out from central London can see the cost (at the moment) of your hotel significantly reduced with no real hassle in travelling back to town.However, this strength can actually be a weakness. Stratford is a hussling, busseling hotbed. There is nothing close by to stroll to to eat apart from the Westfield shopping centre. Stratford is 'being' redeveloped, it is far from redeveloped. Once this transformation is complete I can see the cost of this hotel being raised.Also, as somebody else pointed out, it isn't signposted from the station. It is a good ten minutes walk with light luggage, but I am sure this will change very soon. So, to the Olympic Stadium, it's right there. literally outside the door and down Carpenters road. As such and with HI being a major Olympic sponsor the hotel had Olympic athletes and other Olympic statdium associated clientelle (tradesmen!). The GB mens Waterpolo Team were there for some sort of meeting.In conclusion, I think that at the present time, whilst Stratford metamorphasises itself into...well what ever it becomes and the hotel is sort of stuck out on a limb. If you can live with the slightly dodgy, but should be expected breakfast and a ten minute stroll from the station, undirected and along a typical busy main road you really should consider this hotel. It's cost effective and really convenient for getting back into town.How it will change post Olympics, only time will tell.",May 2012,4.0,44,Traveled on business,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,theozziebloke,below expectations for the incompetent staff,"We have recently spent five nights at the HIE in Stratford. The chain is one of our favourite ones and being a member of the Priority Club Rewards I thought I would have a stay just as great as at the other HIE hotels. I could not be more wrong. The hotel itself is not bad, it is clean and nice. Unfortunately nearly all the staff are incompetent, cold and careless.1) To start with we were given a communicating room. I mean inside our room there was a connecting door to the next room. The first night maybe because we were extremely tired we did not hear any particular noises just voices at a bearable level though. On Good Friday night instead goodness me!! Young men's loud voices, coarse laughters, wild screams. It seemed all that wild party going on was right inside our room. Needless to say we could no longer cope with that so rather than knocking on the connecting door and give the young lads a piece of my mind I rang up the reception. That must have been at around 11:30 pm and spoke to a receptionist who did not sound very willing to cooperate. However he reassured me saying he would soon call the room. In a nutshell he never called them, the phone did not ring in their room and they went on till 1 am when the three of us put some earplugs and fell asleep due to our tiredness. God knows when they stopped painting the town red. 2) One night we decided to have dinner at the hotel. It was around 9:30 pm and we saw some people sitting at the tables while eating their dinner. One lady was just getting her meals when we kindly approached the young waitress who was serving and taking orders. No sooner had I started saying we would like to have dinner than she interruped me saying 'It's too late now. No more dinners.' Provided that probably it might have been too late for the hotel policy but that's definitely not the way you should answer your paying customers. Not apologetic at all, not a single smile, nothing at all. Without any further questioning we just thanked her and walked off. We went to the next-door hotel Travelodge and it was about 9:45 pm by the time we asked their waiter if we could have dinner over there. Not only did he welcome us in a friendly way but said we could order anything we wanted. We then found out he was an Italian chap and  as we are Italian too we had a nice, long conversation. He told us that they regularly served the HIE guests as there seemed to be some problems over there.  3) One afternoon I was waiting for some very important documents from Italy. They had been sent to the hotel email address. When I went over to the reception to get them a very cold, acid and inconsiderate elderly lady receptionist with a French name said there was absolutely nothing under my name. As I was very sure that there was something for me I begged her to look one more time. Totally careless she said nothing once more. Not a smile, not a professional attitude. I called back an office back home and they confirmed that they had successfully sent me the document. Armed with patience I went back with a big smile to the old lady. At first she pretended to be busy at the bar after  some minutes she came to me and tried to say there was still nothing. Thanks to my endurance and patience after insisting she produced some papers. Not a single sorry, not a smile, no apologies at all. I still wonder how such rude people can work with guests at a hotel. 4) The mattresses are so soft you literally sink into them. Very uncomfortable, I had a terrible backache during all my stay. 5) The main channels on TV did not work. (BBC 1, BBC 2 etc)The breakfast is good though even if something is over you had better forget it. They won't bring it back. I asked for a banana as the last one had been taken by a lady before me. During the 10/15 minutes I had my breakfast no bananas came at all. It was  certainly the case to go bananas!!! To end up I gave two points rather than one as it deserved  just because there is a Lithuanian girl Edita at the reception who was the only nice and efficient member of staff, really helpful indeed!!",April 2012,2.0,"1,158",Traveled on business,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

It was a pretty good choice and having stayed at a HI Express in Edinburgh I kinda knew what to expect. Simple but clean, modern accommodation with inclusive breakfast.We checked in at around 1:30pm and the room was ready straight away, room 217 on the 2nd floor. I was a bit apprehensive at first as I usually prefer a high floor room but it was just right, around the corner from the lift so not much walking and not facing the road out front so there was not much noise.The room did face a wall but on looking to the left there was plenty of light and a view of a school playing field, but we did experience a strange whirring noise at times which sounded like a fan going around on the floor below but managed to get to sleep okay although the bed was very soft. The shower was pretty big and only varied in temperature at times and wasn't annoying in anyway. The bathroom and bedroom were spotlessly clean and it was nice they provided free tea and coffee in the room that got refilled daily.I have seen a few complaints about breakfast but we arrived each morning around 9am and had no problem getting a table with clean plates/cutlery and food topped up as I know some hotels wind down the breakfast near the end of service. There was a small selection of hot items inc. scrambled eggs, baked beans, and sausages and felt they could have not made so many beans and put a tray of bacon or hash browns out instead. There was also pastries, croissants, mini baguettes, muller yogurts and a variety of spreads for toast.We came back later in the day with Stratford station only a 10 minute walk away. The high street which you walk down is okay and we walked back late at night with no problems and it really is so easy to get to, just past the travelodge. For safety I think they should have key card access for the lifts like the Premier Inn as anyone could access the floors.After a peaceful nights sleep we were abruptly woken by a fire alarm at 7:35am... not impressed! I had heard previously that this hotel does have a fire alarm test on a Thursday so thought not much of the fire alarm. We decided to get up and find warm clothing and just as we were about to head out the door the fire alarm stopped. We had no phone call from reception to alert of what was going on and then 5 mins later another alarm went off in another block, now surely for safety reasons the whole building should be on the same fire alarm in case the fire spread but im no expert. I eventually called reception to see if we still needed to leave the room but all they did was apologise, not explain why it happened and thought there is just no point trying to get back to sleep! We had breakfast, again quite quiet but I guess people went back to sleep and checked out. I would stay here again if the price is right but now that the premier inn is closer to the station I may stay there to avoid any early morning wake up calls!",April 2012,3.0,377,Traveled as a couple,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

We arrived at Stratford station, and with the Olympics coming you would have thought there would have been signs to hotels, but no.  We eventually found the hotel, but as we were early (11.30 a.m.) were unable to book in, but were told we could leave our bags, and the receptionist would be ""over with a key"" to unlock the luggage room.  After 15 minutes we asked again, and she did eventually come over.  On our return at 7.00 p.m. the check in was quick, our room was very clean and the beds comfortable, but the room was so hot, and we just couldn't fathom how to turn off the heating, even a phone call to reception didn't really help. We resorted to opening the window, not good as our room was at the front, and London is a city that 'never sleeps'!!  Breakfast was an absolute farce, no clean plates, no knives, they just kept running out of everything, even food!  No-one to check anybody into breakfast, so you could just walk in off the street for a free meal.  Tables full of dirty crockery, we struggled to find a table anyway as the place was heaving.

I called to confirm our reservation for a 'smoking room with two twin beds' the night before we arrived and was assured that everything was in order. We checked in at approximately 1:00pm the following day and were told that our 'non-smoking room with one double bed' wouldn't be available until 2:00pm. Obviously the system broke down but the gentleman behind the counter was very helpful and quickly sorted things out for us. We were in room #609 on the top floor which provided a view of the unremarkable east London landscape. The room was small but clean and contained a television, a desk area with a chair, and a kettle with coffee and tea. We found the beds comfortable and each came with two pillows tagged with 'firm' and 'soft' although we couldn't tell the difference. The bathroom was spotless but there are no amenities. The soap and shampoo are one in the same and dispersed from a wall mounted unit in the shower. The towels were a nice size but disappointingly thin. There was no mini-bar or in-room safe, although there are safe deposit boxes in the lobby - there may be a fee attached to use them, we didn't bother. The Expedia website lists 'Wireless Internet Access' as one of the hotel's room amenities but there's a £15 per day charge for that and we passed. The computer in the lobby, if used for less than 10 minutes per day, is free... but longer than that and the £15 charge is applied to your bill. The hotel provides breakfast from 6:30 - 9:30 which is comprised of scrambled eggs, sausage and beans, (it's a British thing), along with the typical assortment of cold items: cereals, breads, fruit. The sausage was extremely poor quality but everything else was quite nice and the hot chocolate from the machine dispenser was surprisingly good.

We asked the reception for a possible room, they sent us away with a very rude manner ( a ""big"" lady). Ok we decided to put our luggages in, as they told they do not have any room which is already usable. No problem. BUT!! In 2 minutes arrived another couple and they could check in!! What kind of hospitality is that?  I can tell that is not! The Greek Lady was helpful all the other receptionists behaved like we are unneccessary things in their lives. They sent us to Stratford International as it is the closest station. Stratford High Street is much closer, it is in half way, we realised ourselves! Room was ok, except there is no safe, no fridge, even no toilet brush :) The internet is for charge, the bed is too soft, if you sit down on it, it goes down 50 cms, funny anway.I have asked for an iron 4 times, after that they sent me an iron from the 1980's  :) Breakfast is terrible, it is good if you would loose some weight. What they are preparing is without any taste. The apples were fine.If you would like to have a shower  take care: if you set for example 38 degrees Celsius , it is sure that it will change suddenly to very hot after that very cold.

At £74 per night, I would expect to be able to sleep comfortably.  The mattress was too soft, coupled with being on top of a partly-sprung bed base; this made for a night of tossing and turning trying to get some sleep.Overall, I think that this particular hotel is perhaps not managed as well as it could be.  One of the lifts was out of order throughout the duration of our stay, the lavatories on the ground floor near the bar were disgusting, and the ashtray outside the front door was overflowing.In the corridor outside our room, there was a leak from the ceiling that dripped into a plastic container.  We spoke to the duty manager about the sleep quality and were told that he had not had any complaints, and considering that on the HIE feedback form there is no question relating to sleep quality, I am not surprised!We wrote to HIE to complain on returning home but three days later, no response (not exactly what I would call top-notch customer service).

Yes, it was reasonable (after negotiation), yes clean and the staff very good.  So very much under pressure I think, by the manager who sat every day in the bar on the laptop.  Every question or complaint was answered with a look over my shoulder to the manager to see if shehad heard and I am sure concerned about the answer given.There was a fire alarm one night of my stay.  The evacuation was pitiful, guests were unsure what to do and had to shoulder charge a double fire exit to get it to open.No roll call, and in fact a guest took over the job to ensure everyone was out.  Once the all clear was given everyone piled back in, even though the alarm was still going off intermittently.  Was it another alarm?  Fortunately not, just the fact the staff and the manager didn't know or could not, reset the alarm.I understand this hotel is run by London Inns; I would feel the brand was being damaged by this hotel if I was part of the Holiday Inn Group.  I decamped to the Ibis in the end.  Maybe not so well appointed but the staff were great and the breakfast offer much more civilised.

They are all so run down...hope their respective owners pull their fingers out of their arses in time for the Olympics...I am not a Londoner (or Brit for that matter), but seriously think that London deserves better calling cards than this.

With the underground station a 10 minute walk away, this wasn't a huge deal but there wasn't much locally to do.  There is a cool looking local pub called the Builders Arms was just up the street, unfortunately for some reason it was closed the weekend we were there so cannot comment, but there is a pub worth visiting called the Edward VII...great food!  Anyway the hotel was good, main issue was one of the lifts was broken and stayed that way for our entire 3 days stay.  Obvious result was delays in the lobby. We took the stairs when we were impatient, but for those with bags, kids etc it was a pain.  Seemed odd that an technician couldn't be arranged...maybe because it was a long weekend?

I was wrong.My mother in law boked the htel room for us. She booked a double room with a cot for our 11 month old daughter. When we arrived we were told that there had been a mistake and that we were booked in a twin room with no cot. We were told the cot would not fit in the room. So after waiting in the reception area for 30 minutes we were shown a double room which was a smoking room. This was dismissed straight away as it had a horrible smell of stale smoke. So finally after an hour of waiting we were given the twin room that they had origanally booked us in which the cot did fit it. On the thursday afternon we arrived back to the hotel to find that no room service had been. No clean towles,bins not emptied,no tea or coffee ect. So called reception and asked for some new ones. We rang twice in half an hour and in the end my husband had to go down and get it.Then to top it all of the fire alarm sounded at 10pm Thursday night. Unsure of what was happening i called reception 3 times for the phone to go unansweres. i left the room and went to see what was going on.I went from the 5th floor to the ground only for the doors to be locked. I then had to run back up the 5 flights of stairs to tell my husband that we should leave the hotel. Wrapping my daughter in a blanket we left the hotel to find guests and staff all stood outside. We were out there for about 40 minutes. It was freezing and not one memeber of staff came to see if we were ok ( more my daughter than us) No one told us what was going on .

I have stayed a many Holiday Inn's and i am part of their Priority Club Program,  i am a GOLD Member.The room was a great size and was very much to the standard of a Holiday Inn Express however the staff and the breakfast cleanliness was not. As a gold member you can normally check in to a hotel anytime after 12noon provided they have a room ready.

This was not a problem for me until i asked the breakfast staff for a clean glass. Only to be informed that they were all clean and washed in hot water, when i showed the staff member the pulp inside she replied with ""there is nothing we can do about the pulp and they have been washed in hot water"". (I know how the glass washes work and every glass is supposed to be polished after they come out). The girl on breakfast then told me i could drink from a coffee cup and that she has never gotten sick from drinking out of the glasses.

The hotel is a ten minute walk away from Stratford Station and if you do stay during the winter period, then it can be quite a treacherous walk from the tube station to the hotel.  From my first stay, the staff were really friendly and accommodating.  In this regard, two members of staff stand out and these are Stella and Joel.  I have seen reception crowded and the staff being bombarded with requests for information and also guests wanting to check in and they dealt with everything admirably.I have never eaten at the hotel as due to my work I am either late arriving back at the hotel or I order a take away from the menus that are available from reception, which nobody seemed to mention in their reviews.  However I have seen some of the food being delivered to other guests and it doesn’t look that bad at all.  3 courses for just over £15 seems quite reasonable to me.The facilities are what you expect from the HIX brand and I have stayed in many, with most of them being in London.  I just haven’t had time to review them all!  However, this one stands out as one of the best I have stayed in while working in London.  I get the train down from Leeds, so don’t use the car park.  If there are indeed only 10 spaces and the charge is £20 per night, then this is quite exorbitant and as some other reviewers have pointed out, you wouldn’t really want to leave your car anywhere else but a secure place overnight.The internet charges are quite steep as well and I have seen these rise over the time I have stayed at the hotel.  I now use a dongle as it’s much easier, or failing that, your phone if it’s just browsing that you’re after.  There is a convenience store over the road which has the basics of what you might need (they have had enough money from me over the months!), but if you are after something more then there is always the shopping centre opposite the bus station where there is a Sainsbury’s and a Morrisons and a host of other shops.I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I am working on the East side of London as it’s ideal.  And if you do book in advance and can be fairly certain that your travel arrangements will not change, then you can pick up a room for about £62.00 on an advance rate which I once did.

Managed to get checked in earlier than the usual check in time which was handy given we arrived at Heathrow at 6 am after flying from Australia.

It is NOT a five minutes walk to the station but it is a reasonable 10 minutes walk.  Be aware that the wireless internet connection is NOT included with the room.  It costs quite a bit and if you are staying for more than a couple of days, you would be money ahead to invest in a phone dongle that you can just connect to your usb port.  You can also use the free wireless at the Pizza restaurant across the street from the station (beside the cinema).Beware of booking a ""standard"" room, because you are likely to get a handicapped room which is slightly larger but has no shower curtain in the bathroom.  On the other hand, you can bathe sitting down, if that's your thing.The beds are soft, like American beds, rather than hard British-style beds.  The hotel is staffed by non-English speakers, but that is to be expected in London these days.  Breakfast is edible if you stick to the toast and cereal.  Despite the published menu, they do NOT serve bacon.  It's strictly congealed eggs and greasy bangers.  But you can make your own toast, or eat mediocre croissants with all the butter and jelly you like.  It is at the future Olympic site, so there is construction everywhere.  It happens 7 days a week.  But unless you are planning to sleep in late every day, it shouldn't bother you.  This is not a good hotel if you are driving your car as the parking is excessive.

I went upstairs back to the room. I had to find a housekeeper myself to get the room cleaned again.Later that evening, I checked out. Also, I was so disappointed to find that there were no parking spaces available and had to park at the local Bingo car park.All in all, I was so disappointed with my stay and the callous attitude of the staff.I did not make a fuss at the time, as I am not that sort of a person but felt I should let someone know as this is a serious health and safety issue and also that staff should be a bit more caring.On a good note, the hotel was clean and the room well decorated.I can promise you that I sure will not be staying at this hotel again.",June 2011,2.0,"2,896",Traveled on business,2.0,-1,4.0,2.0,-1,3.0

The hotel is modern and positioned beside a busy main road.  An issue with the aircon system meant there was a vibrating noise throughout the night. (as if next door had a mobile phone vibrating on the bedside table).  The hotel advertises a car park which is true it does have but what it doesn't say is that there only around 10 spaces.  It's a first come first served basis and if you don't get a space you are rather limited to options.  Personally I wouldn't like to leave my vehicle parked overnight in the area.As with many Holiday Inn Express hotels Stratford offers a small bar menu on an evening.

Our family room was also clean and adequately equipped, with a choice of firm/soft pillows.  Reception staff were helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage there several hours before check-in.The breakfast was something else altogether.  The buffet area is cramped when busy.  Whilst waiting, supplies of trays, coffee cups and bread all ran out and took a long time to be replenished.  There was no bacon at all and they were serving sausages instead which also ran out.  I was told there would be more in 5 mins so I waited, then I was told they'd be another 5 mins.

First of all let me say that the hotel is very cozy and nice, the refurbishing is all done, so no construction noise and posted in previous reviews. Second, in my opinion it's location is great. The Stratford train/tube/bus station is just 8-10 minutes away, 5 minutes if you walk lively. There is a small shopping mall just opposite to the station, and at the end of the year a huge mall will open right besides the station, so that will be great. so like i said, easy and quick access to any part of london, mind you, there is also a bus station right in front of the hotel, but i would not recommend you take the bus from the central area to the hotel, because it will be a 1 hour journey at least, so take the tube instead, much faster. All in all, the hotel is perfect for a weekend get-away, or even a longer visit to london. one more thing, if you do decide to visit london and stay at this hotel, if you arrive in london via luton and you travel in a group of 4-5-6 people, i recommend you hire one of those private taxi's, instead of taking a bus to central london and then the tube to stratford. Besides the fact that you don't have to walk around dragging you luggage along, if you are a group of 5 people, it will cost you almost the same and bus+tube, so better choice all around (not applicable if only 2-3 persons).",March 2011,4.0,1,Traveled with friends,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

If you know HI Express, then you know basically what to expect, but this is a better one overall. Our room was spotlessly clean and, despite the hotel being right on a major road, incredibly quiet. My only gripe about the room is the usual one about the low level of lighting even with all lights on! Beds were softer than some (way too hard!) ones we've had elsewhere which helped lead to a good night's sleep.The staff at reception were friendly and helpful, and the public dining/seating area was modern, comfortable and again very clean. Breakfast was one of the best I have had at HI Express over the years; all the usuals plus fruit options I haven't always seen and more conserves than standard (lemon marmalade!). The serving area wasn't huge but it was big enough to go round without too many problems even when busy.The immediate area round the hotel is not great (quite run down + lots of building going on with Olympics/regeneration) but it's easy to get into central London and cheaper than being more central.

On the positive side, it is a short walk from the centre of Stratford and the transport interchange which allows bus, rail, underground or DLR travel.  It is around 20-25 mins to Westminster on the Jubilee Line.  The hotel itself is fairly new already but has just been refurbished.  The check-in was smooth but nothing special.  The room was fine, the sofa bed had been set up for our little one and the shower room has a neat feature whereby the door can shut on the toilet allowing the shower/basin to be used by someone else.  The main bed was quite soft, the sofa bed seemed more comfortable to me.  Our room was a little noisy as it overlooked the main road and several emergency vehicles seemed to pass during the night!However, all the positives were undone by the breakfast.  Holiday Inn Express are making a big deal about their breakfasts now having hot food.  Well, ours didn't, in fact I think we'd have grounds to report them to the ASA.  As we arrived just before 9am, the last of the sausages and bacon had been finished by other guests.  In the 15-20 minutes we were there, these were not replenished at all.  For a time there were no mugs for tea/coffee, there were no small spoons for drinks or yoghurts and the fruit juice was without doubt a mix of at least 80% juice 20% water - and that is being charitable.

A trip including 2 nights in this hotel, which was reasonable priced for London standards.The hotel location is fair since the walking distance to Stratford station (Underground Julilee and Central line, DLR) and the Stratford shopping centre.During our stay a lot of construction works going on for the 2012 Olympics, but not nearby the hotel, it's closer to the station.The check-in was very good, since we got a room immediately (even before noon!). Maybe it helped since I am priority club member. The room was on the 4th floor and very spacious. The bed was just renewed (matress) I personally didn't find it comfortable for sleeping. Also the room to outside did not properly close, so the room had ""fresh"" air all the time. The bathroom was spacious also, showergel and shampoo is provided for, as well towels replaced every day.The only item to complain in the bathroom is the not so constant temperature of the warm water. During my showers, it was flucuating to ""very hot"" and ""ice cold"" and back to my desired temperature. It was frustrating, sometimes. Anyway we were in London for the town, not the hotel, so the rooms in this hotel are very well ok.I must ask your and the hotel's attention for the breakfast, through!It was located in a large room (size of 3 hotel rooms, walls removed) and very warm inside. Food was available in the hall, where some tables were positioned (see photo).Variaty of food was limited or out of stock, refills took too long.Another item which I didn't like was the WiFi internet which is charged for. Nowadays this should be very common. In several countries it's normal to find WiFi for free in bars and even 2* hotels. Why can't Holiday Inn (Express) not make such arrangements? Even if that needs to be charged for, raise your hotel room fare with GBP 0.50 per night to get out of the investment, instead of charging these high fares for just 30 minutes.I conclude that this hotel is convenient for shopping, quietly located in outer-London but easy to reach. Room spacious, breakfast not good. Pricing is average but for the service we got maybe a bit expensive. I think it's a hit or miss during your future stay and I would recommend you to consider other hotels.",December 2010,3.0,158,Traveled as a couple,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

By far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in in this country. Firstly the hotel was a building site, apparently being revamped for the olympics - but God help anybody who stays there, the customer service is shocking.Whilst we were at work, my colleague's room was emptied of her stuff, even though she was still checked in for another night. When she asked reception what had happened to it they said the maid must've removed t by mistake and it would be in lost property. After checking, it became apparent that all that was there was a pair of jeans - absolutely everything she brought with her had been stolen, either from the room by the maid, or from lost property. They even took her toothbrush and underwear. Reception were not apologetic or helpful at all - they said they didn't know who had cleaned the room and we would have to wait until the next day at 9am when the maids came in for work. I said this was not acceptable and the reception manager got very agitated. I asked him to provide a toothbrush, toothpaste and other necessities for my colleague from a machine in the reception with petty cash as it was the least he could do and he was rude and said no initially, until we asked him several times when he at last gave in.We had a lot of children staying in the hotel with us that night, almost 200 and the hotel were unable to cater for them. Becuase of the building work (they didn't tell us about) there was dining available in a conference room on the third floor. The food was served from the kitchen on the ground, pushed through the building site on a trolley wth clingfilm on top and brought up in a lift. It was cold and there was not enough to go round - the chef was constantly running up and downstairs to make more and we had a queue of hungry kids all the way down the corridoor for over an hour.The food provided was unacceptable, we had paid £10 a head for a healthy meal and drink for the children but were told firstly that a drink was not included (even though we had paid for it) and it took four of us to demand that the children were at least served some fruit squash with their meal.THe 'healthy meal' was some inedible mince, chips and vegetables which were stll frozen in the centre - we know because we checked. Or, for the vegetarians, dry pasta with a scoop your own sauce that looked and tasted like cheap tomato soup, served in a bowl on the table so it went cold quickly and was not replaced throughout the servce. It was absolutely disgusting.  Many of the kids went to bed hungry and some went out to buy pot noodles out of their own pocket. The previous night I was told that there was no vegetarian option and when I said to the reception manager ""what happens if one of the children is vegetarian?"" he replied simply ""then they shall not eat this evening, we have nothing for them"". I could go on forever about how bad this hotel was but the main thing is that I would never in a million years stay there again and my company has now struck it off our list of approved accommodation, so hopefully they will lose a lot of business as we are one of the biggest corporations in the UK.",January 2011,1.0,39,Traveled on business,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

I was absolutely amazed to find that while there were multiple pay tv channels there was not even basic digital tv. The food was overpriced and of poor quality. My chicken ceasar salad (according to the menu with anchovy fillets and parmesan shavings - though I could find none!) was essentially bland overcooked chicken on a bowl of soggy iceberg lettuce swimming in ceasar dressing.

I insisted that there had only been two overnight guests, and she finally, after several more minutes of pouting and general rudeness, said that she would not be charging me an additional £35 as if she was doing me some kind of favour.

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,YorksLadyYorkshire,Would return without hesitation - if the location was better.,"As has been mentioned, the surrounding areas are slightly run down, and if you're thinking of staying here it would be an idea to acquaint yourself with the area beforehand, and to buy an Oyster card. We arrived before midnight but felt apprehensive when the cab driver advised us to be extra careful - especially late at night. It wasn't the best of introductions to the area, but like most stations in busy cities, it did have a few dubious characters wandering around. But please remember this was only at the station itself, which is within easy reach of the hotel. The cab fare was approximately £7.00 from the station to the hotel, so good value, especially when travelling with heavy cases late at night. But if you're not averse to the few dubious characters, it's easily walkable to the hotel and is also on a bus route - one stop from Stratford station. The check in was fine and we were allocated a top floor room overlooking the main and very busy road. This wasn't a problem to us as both lifts were working fine and even if you're a very light sleeper, the double glazing drowns out most of the noise. But if you like to sleep with the window open, it would be advisable to ask for a room on the other side. The room was large and clean, as was the bedding and the bathroom. No faults at all with the housekeeping - it was exemplary. The only minor negative point was a stain on the cover of the sofa but as we only used it to put bags on, it wasn't a problem. The bed tended to lean towards the middle, but was comfortable after a hectic day spent in London. The bathroom, which is in fact a shower room, was spotless, as were the towels. We always take our own toiletries but there are dispensers for hand and body wash near the sink and in the shower, and a vending machine near the foyer if you forget anything like toothpaste. The nearby shopping centre in Stratford should cover just about anything else you may need.As has been mentioned in previous reviews, there was no hot food available that weekend, but the receptionists are more than happy to order a take-away for you to eat in your room, providing it's not overly late. The take-away menus, although of limited choice, can be found near the vending machine, and one meal was ample to feed two of us, and at approximately £10 including delivery, good value for London. The continental breakfasts are standard but adequate enough to start the day off. If, as we did, you find yourself slightly disorientated with the area, just ask. The girls on reception were a credit to the hotel, and if they couldn't immediately help with directions to various places, they Googled the areas and handed us printouts, which was a very kind and helpful gesture. I can't recommend highly enough the benefits of buying an Oyster card on your arrival in London, especially if you're staying for sight-seeing in London. These, topped up with £30 each, was more than enough for us to traverse across the city and further, and to have credit available at the end of the stay. Much cheaper than taxis. There's a bus stop a couple of minutes away from the hotel, and it's only one stop to Stratford station. As it was a weekend, there were various disruptions due to works being carried out, but at no time did we find this a problem. There's alternative routes to be taken and the station staff were very helpful. If returning from London to Stratford, and need a bus to the hotel, go to platform C at the bus station and get on any red bus - it's as easy as that, and where your Oyster card comes in handy. It's also handy for the DLR and buses. Should you wish to travel out to Beckton to the smaller shopping outlets, it's one stop from the hotel to the station, and a bus (I think it was the 252 or 262 but please ask - the local people were also more than helpful) takes you directly to Beckton Triangle (with it's Next and Boots clearance stores) or Gallion's Reach shopping centre, and which takes under an hour. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and the hotel staff. The only downside was the distance from the city to the hotel, especially if you need to return more than once in a day, (but who'd want to?) and the lack of cooked food at the weekend.  If you prefer to travel by taxi to and from the hotel it might work out cheaper to book a Holiday Inn that's more central. If not, then I'd recommend this hotel if you're travelling by car, or for a long weekend providing you don't mind the DLR and frequent tube changes.. If we could have picked this hotel up, and dropped it to a place nearer the attractions, it would have been near perfect for our needs. Our stay cost us £159 for 3 nights B&B, but look around for any offers at the Holiday Inn site.Thank you to all at the hotel and I hope this has been of some help to any readers.",May 2009,4.0,4,Traveled as a couple,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,-1

Holiday Inn Express London Stratford,3.0,4.0,Very good,4.0,4.5,4.0,sc3traveller,Pleasant Experience - Recommended!,"Really pleased with our recent visit to the Stratford Holiday Inn. We arrived on New Year's Eve at around 12:00 and were allowed to check in, even though normal check in time starts at 2:00. We had requested a room at the back of the building (not facing the busy highway), but were told this information was not on their booking system. I found this rather peculiar since I had booked directly with the hotel website. In the end, the reception staff accommodated our request without too much persuasion.The room was clean and compact; no complaints. I did notice that instead of providing a complimentary shampoo/shaving cream/ sewing kit, etc. in the bedroom, you must now request it from staff. Cost cutting I suppose. Overnight, the room was quiet and we had a restful sleep (no outdoor noise or sounds from neighbouring rooms) - a real feat considering it was New Year's Eve!The one drawback to this hotel is its location in East London. It takes about 25 minutes to travel by underground to Westminster station (central London), plus approx 10-15 minutes to walk to the Stratford station. That said, I feel it is not unreasonable as long as you only take the trip once a day. However, if you like to do a bit of sightseeing and then come back to your room and relax before heading out again, you'll find this hotel's location inconvenient. Access to London via the Stratford station is flexible, with the Jubilee, Circle and DLR lines, as well as  Overland trains operating from this station. There is a bus depot outside the Stratford station. Depending on what underground ticket you purchase, it may include buses, which would cut down on your walking time to and from the hotel.",December 2008,4.0,127,not mentioned,4.0,3.0,5.0,-1,4.0,-1

But we experienced many things that were out of order, and they were only partially fixed during our stay.When we arrived, we noticed that the water went out of the sink very slowly. We had to remove the plug entirely in order to be able to use the sink at all. The electric kettle was only working if you were standing beside it keep pressing it down towards the table. The light bulb in the toilet would not turn on. At night we discovered that the TV remote control did not work, so we could not set the alarm clock to wake us up in the morning. We used the alarm on our cell phone, but unfortunately, it was set to Danish local time (without us thinking of it), so we got up 1 hour earlier (ok, I know that this is our fault and not the hotel). Instead of waiting an hour for the hotel to open breakfast, we went to the city to get an English breakfast. When we returned, we told the clerk about our problems (and that the cleaning staff had taken the bed linned from our extra bed (for our son) without putting a new one on (even not in the room at all). They would come up and have a look at it. It took a long time, we were about to go to bed, so we called them on the phone, and they were in our room after 5 min.They brought an extra kettle, swaped the remote (to one that worked better, but not good) and gave us an extra linned for the extra bed. Regarding the light bulp, the maintainer was not around, so they could not switch the bulb. They said that they could transfer us to another room, but we did not think of the problem to be that important and desided to stay in the room rather than packing all our stuff together and then unpack it again. We forgot to look at the sink problem.In the next morning during breafast, both the coffee machine and the juice machine was out of order. The staff open up the door to a meeting room, where you could get coffee, but no juice. So our son had to start the day with a glass of coffee milk to drink - they could not fix the juice problem and had no backup for this.  )-:Why were there so many things not working, and why didn't cleaning staff or anyone other notice the problems with the bulb and slow draining water by themselves? It should be an easy thing to find out when turning the switch and no lights come up and when cleaning the sink.... strange.The hotel is most likely staffed less than needed.Sad, because these small things should be easy to fix and would to me give the hotel a much better rating.Bad parking facilities, but ok, this is probably a general problem in London.Regards, Larshttp://lars.eberhardt-bonnesen.dk",July 2006,2.0,2,Traveled with family,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,-1

Small details, but they can make the difference between a good and an excellent stay.Having mentioned that, the matter was resolved as there was a generally available microwave near reception.

Breakfast was great choice of cereals, pastries and of course a cooked breakfast.  The area was set out very well, and particularly liked the gluten free choices being available.

This hotels has restaurants and bars close by but no noise (unless the window is open), 30 seconds to shopping centre, 5min walk to the tube/train and a bit more onto Stratford high street.The only downside and what stopped me awarding 5* was some of the attention to detail in a 4* hotel and for the price we'd paid was...door seal in shower was missing and located behind the bathroom door, a wine glass was missing from the glass shelves and these had not been dusted as regularly as they should have been.

Not so many options as at the Holiday Inn, but that works for us. We were on the 11th floor. It is quiet. The lifts work efficiently.

Good aircon, gave a nice temperature throughout and was very quiet overnight. Bathroom very nice and kitchen area a big bonus compared to a normal hotel room. Friendly staff. Big plus was the 12th floor lounge area with the complimentary tea & coffee and the views over London. Perfect location for Olympic Park, when you step out the front door you’re prettt much stepping onto the concourse to approach the stadium (3-4 minutes walk to entrance). There is very easy access from St Pancras, took 7 minutes on high speed overground and Stratford International Station was 4-5 minutes walk away (with luggage). With it being part of the Westfield complex, there were plenty of restaurants and shops in immediate location and the atmosphere was always very good.An excellent stay all around and, provided the prices are sensible, we will definitely be back next time we visit the stadium.",July 2019,5.0,31,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The bed was comfy enough and the shower was good. Although I got a disabled room somehow and cba to ask for a new room so ended up having to sit down to wash). My only qualm was with the tv.

On arrival follow signs to Westfield. You will see the Holiday Inn (occupying the lower floors of the same building) on exiting.I had a warm greeting from Maria and was offered a chocolate. I explained that I booked a deluxe suite for a night and a standard for the next two and asked if I could stay in the same room if possible. She said she would try (the hotel was running full). Our deluxe king (there are no twin single beds - only at the Holiday Inn) suite was spacious with a seperate sitting room and kitchenette - pristine and everything was in order. Beds are very comfy. Wifi worked well enough to stream videos. Housekeeping super efficient. Nespresso in room with 4 capsules.Breakfast is included with a decent spread of hot and cold choices.Social evening 7-8pm mondays to Wednesdays with free snacks and drinks.4 washers/dryers in a laundry room.Gym has cycles and a resistance machine but you can use the holiday inn gym if you must use a treadmill.Room service good.Bird e-scooters for hire at Olympic Park.Central line you to Oxford circus in 30mins. My advice is pay a little more for the deluxe suite - it has a seperate sitting room which makes for good personal space for a (snoring) father and son.Overall i would readily come back to stay and it deserves the 5* i am giving.

We got there and had been given a complimentary upgrade to a one bedroom suite which was absolutely beautiful. View from the window across London was amazing. Only little gripe was that the hotel doesn't have a bar so you have to go to the holiday inn located in the same building. Breakfast the next day was not what I expected for the cost of staying in the hotel. Boiled eggs were overcooked, scrambled eggs were all stuck together from keeping warm, but there was a nice selection of food, though it would have been nice if fried eggs were on offer. Getting back to the hotel after the concert was an absolute nightmare due to the stadiums ridiculous crowd control, and the route to the hotel was shut off which we were unaware that this would happen so we had to walk all the way around to get back to the hotel, concert finished at 2230, it was gone midnight by the time we got into the hotel which is less than a 5 minute walk away.

The underground and overground trains are in walking distance and gets you quickly into the capital.  There is also the Olympic Park on your doorstep and the Olympic stadium currently home ground for West Ham United, if you love ya footie and don't mind the rivalry of the hammers you can take a tour of the stadium.

The en suite has includes an enormous shower. The best thing was just how lovely and quiet it was. Thinking about food, the complimentary cooked breakfast was a big surprise. Similar to Holiday Inn Express but with much more choice. For dinner you have more options than I can list, room service, restaurant and bar downstairs in the Holiday Inn, or go out to one of the many restaurants literally a few steps away in the shopping centre. If you don’t fancy any of those options you can always cook for yourself. There is a shop in reception with ready meals, drinks, etc but better value would be the Sainsbury’s just across the road from the station. The staff were great too and couldn’t be any more helpful.

We stayed whilst attending the O2 which was only 2 stops away on the jubilee line, The social guest gathering held Monday to Wednesday was nice. Staff were very friendly and helpful, and everywhere was spotless.Breakfast was very good - not the most extensive I have had - but a large range of juices and milks (including Soya) are  available from the fridge still in the original cartons was very good. Again the breakfast staff were lovely. 24 hour coffee  is also available. No bar or restaurant facilities on site but within a stones throw of Westfield and the Olympic park mean plenty of choice. You can also use the Holiday inn bar that adjoins the hotel. Great views across to the park and London skyline.I have given 5* because of the above which override the 2 points I do not like.:-Pillows are still too hard for me with no soft option, I raised this last year and was told to email before arrival, which I did, but the pillows on the bed were the same as last year i.e. hard and further replacements were the same. This is not a cheap hotel and I do feel that a pillow option should be available, I am aware that lots of people would find the pillow fine.Finally, a Nesspresso machine in the suite is always welcome, but why provide only 4 pods and 4 milk jiggers for the total stay, this penalises the longer staying guest and again, bearing in mind the hotel price andmarket seems very mean.",November 2018,5.0,279,Traveled as a couple,4.0,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,-1

Not suitable for business travel,"I arrived at the hotel at quarter to midnight having a confirmed and guaranteed reservation though a corporate travel agent. The hotel staff informed me that my room was given away (!) to a nearby Holiday Inn and there was no room left.Staybridge Suites didn’t start looking for a room for me until 40 min later and this took 3 hours, due to the city being full that night. In the mean while I was offered a very low standard hotel 2 hours drive away as a replacement. Staybridge charged me for the nIght even though the room wasn’t available to me and I agreed to use my credit card as the guarantee at the replacement hotel. Staybridge was supposed to resolve the payment issue “first thing in the morning”. The resolution didn’t happen until the week later after I brought my corporate travel agent into the picture! Considering I arrived for business with sharp time schedule and deliverables, surviving the day after on 3 hours of sleep was a miserable experience. The way the management didn’t follow up on this (no sms the day confirming that I have a room, not reading messages left by the reception staff) to bad handling of this matter after that (providing wrong invoices at the check out, not ensuring the funds exchange with the replacement hotel as promised until escalated, claiming to not being able to find my email address after the check out) makes it to be a very unprofessional behavior.

On the top floor, you'll find the gym, laundry room and restaurant/bar. The room itself is perfectly adequate, comes with a small kitchen (I didn't use) and a decent offering as a bathroom.  The main plus point is the nespresso machine with complimentary pods (4)...you can buy more if you need. For food, there's a pantry next to the reception desk, however, it's quite expensive, so may be worthwhile popping into one of the many supermarkets in the area.I didn't eat evening meals here, though on a Monday - Wednesday there is a 'social' event where you can get some nibbles and some complimentary drinks - that's a big plus after a day in the office.Breakfast offering was adequate for me - yoghurt, granola, fruit compote and scrambled eggs - couple of coffee machines too for that fresh cup of coffee in the morning top it off. The drawback to me was the gym, and how woeful it was - it wasn't until my second use that I realised I could have used the gym in the Holiday Inn, which whilst just as woeful, had free weights.  Don't expect to be able to do much of a routine here - though, do ask to pop into Holiday Inn if you want weights.I had the same issue as the Holiday Inn, in that my card was not preloaded with access to the gym (still don't understand why). Between the two offerings, I'd choose the Holiday Inn.

There are facilities to cook if you fancy staying in, with supermarkets near by in the shopping Centre to get anything you want. We are out locally every evening in the super local restaurants .

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,highlanderfil,"If you like big box retail, sloppy maintenance and dishonest management, look no further","Stayed for just under a week on a business trip. The hotel is located in a giant mall, so if that's your thing, you'll find yourself with no shortage of shopping options, as well as grocery stores for saving money on meals (this is, after all, an extended stay hotel). All told, it's an unremarkable IHG property which is ranked far too high on the list of overall London hotels for what it is. Here's what it is/offers:- It's not cheap. Our corporate (ostensibly discounted) rate was around $200/night.- It has a breakfast that is plentiful in options, but somehow resoundingly underwhelming. Your mileage will vary in accordance with your level of pickiness.- There are occasional evening happy hours with free food and drinks.- It's an extended stay property, so there is a kitchen (fairly well-stocked) and laundry facilities (with absolutely atrocious dryers that take, no joke, three hours to fully complete a load). Fair warning: staff at the hotel did not know what dryer sheets were and don't have any in the pantry (though they do have laundry detergent pods). So make sure you make a pit stop at a Sainsbury's to pick some up.- The corridors are carpeted. Guess what that means for ease of rolling heavy bags.- Bed sheet thread count is somewhere in the double digits.- The TV channel options are indecipherable. There seem to be about a thousand overall channels of which about five work.- Wi-fi will annoyingly ask you to log in anew every day.And so on and so forth. I'm as picky as the next guy, but, honestly, the hotel is just fine. What was NOT fine was an episode we had and how the hotel management chose to treat it. This is what happened:Since we were staying for a fairly lengthy period of time, we made full use of the available drawers so as not to live out of our suitcases. What do you normally expect when you pull out a drawer? I usually expect it to be protected by some kind of stopping device so that it doesn't fall on my foot. Apparently, the fine folks of Staybridge Suites London-Stratford City don't agree. Both my wife and I managed to fall victim to the vicious left night stand drawer (two drawers, both unsecured, one hit each). Ouch. Well, mistakes happen, right? We notified the staff and were assured it would be fixed.Would that it were so. As we were checking out, I felt that familiar stinging feeling of pressed wood digging into the top of my foot at high speed. Apparently, maintenance did fix the night stand, but only halfway. So, the top drawer had the stoppers installed, but not the bottom.I mentioned this to the guys on the reception desk (who, by the way, credited me 14 GBP back in my pantry purchases for the trouble while being very adamant that I mention their names in my Tripadvisor review). Honestly, the 14 GBP didn't do very much for me, as my stay was covered by my company, but I didn't feel like pressing the issue and I was happy to leave it alone until the day manager, Eddie, caught up with me at the elevator. Here is what Eddie said to me, pretty much verbatim:""I overheard your conversation with my colleagues and would like to apologize. I am the day manager here. I know it won't help what's already happened, but could I maybe offer you some points in compensation? Ten...twenty thousand? (Thanks!) They will be posted right away!""Cool. Twenty thousand points comes out to about $100 by most travel websites' valuations, which seemed perfectly fair to me given the situation. Unfortunately, the points had failed to post ""right away"". I checked for a few days and then wrote the hotel a note. I was told that an ""investigation"" with IHG needed to take place before receiving a second e-mail showing a total of 3,000 points in two separate transactions being pending. When I asked what happened to the original promise, the responding manager told me Eddie didn't have the authority to make the offer, but he would graciously extend his ""token"" offer to 5K points (which have since posted).That's about it. I will leave you to draw your own conclusions about this incident. I will draw my own and stay elsewhere next time.",May 2018,2.0,102,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,3.0,2.0,3.0,-1

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,almightytez,One night free in hospital,"I like to start off by thanking you for my Bank holiday bonus on the Rolling Stones Weekend, When Bookings As IHG Platinum Member ( I Never Expected 1 Night Free in Homerton hospital hackney from yourself Nicholas. Wow what a fantastic experience, Here’s the deal Folks if your looking for Great night out like me and my wife was then book no further here is the place to stay.  As pointed out by operational manager it was my fault. That either Something Ate or drank at the hotel.  I’ll like to point out we only purchased drink and food from the hotel so I will leave you to do the maths.  Because it gone midnight time I started throwing up & collapsing on the bathroom floor then disaster struck I ended up messing myself it was not a pretty site in fact it was something like out of Horror movie. My wife find me collapsed on the bathroom floor. She was so distressed she could not use the phone in the room to get me help.  After working out how to call the front desk the Night manager came to the room where he told me I’ll get help.  I laid for 2 hours of the floor but again this was pointed out by the operational manager Nicholas this was my fault. We called 999 3 Times from my mobile phone to be told we are having trouble finding you we was right in the heart Westfield shopping centre Stratford. Not only did the Paramedics help me they also cleaned and wash me down because of the state I was left in. Once put in the Ambulance the Crew try to put line in, I had 10 ml of morphine and an anti-sick drug to help me.  After being in hospital all night , My wife and me returned back to hotel via taxi to be greeted by staff saying you’re in time for breakfast I was quite shocked by the comments and the remarks I pointed out I’ve been up all night no sleep and been in hospital all we wanted to do was sleep we asked was it okay to return back to our room to be informed the cleaners do not start till 9 AM so Our room 1212 would still have sick and human waste on the bathroom floor, and would not be suitable for us to return too, staff said we have a spare room you can go into and once their room was cleaned we could collect our belongings.   It was it so lovely the operations manager Nicholas called me in room 1210 so asked if we could have a meeting at 1:30 PM to discuss what happened to me I couldn’t believe it really the hotel knew we been up all night and all we wanted to do was recover and sleep with this too much to ask I asked yourself.  At midday the cleaner who could not speak proper English started putting our belongings into a rubbish bag when I asked her to stop she said you have to leave and then she said do you still want this I went to the front desk and complained and insisted somebody came to the room I said we are still paying guests till 2 PM I do not expect to be treated in this manner by any one.  There was lady being checking in at the time I was polite and very firm to the staff at no point was I rude to her or to the lady checking in.  This whole Experience could have been avoided  1. Once room was ok to return too 2. Hotel Porter to remove items to new room 3. Store items so we could pick them all up 4. Treat everyone with respect The General manager gave my wife and me two large bottles of water he also went on to say under the circumstances he feel we should have a complimentary night as a way of saying sorry he also pointed out he would have to talk to the operational manager first but as I found out afterwards the operational manager Said No only was happy for if we paid to stay on or we used our points. He said we give you till 4 PM , it was disgusting how we was treated.  it was pointed out in the meeting by myself and Nicholas as No point was I Rude or using  abusive language, as Nicholas pointed out in a very rude and unprofessional email to myself Day later. and on checkout I told valine I would not pay for an overseas call to Rome as it was made when my wife and me was in hospital. At No point did I intimidate or refuse to pay the outstanding bill. There was New member of staff who was in training asked us to return to the hotel in the future which my wife and myself refused.  We left with our belongings up on top of a wheelchair and one walking stick normally we would eat lunch at hotel before asking for taxi home.   I Think if the Hotel would have just left it, you would never know about this incidents.  On Wednesday day after returning home The operational manager decided to take it upon himself and send out an unprofessional email.  it was disgusting behaviour to see how someone in this high up position was talking to me.  You may Be able to bullying or threatening staff into doing things by emails  but how Disgusting to talk to me in this manner.  Nicholas went on to say it was my fault for the incident at the hotel he basically called me a liar and he said myself and my wife was banned from returning to the Hotel IHG Stalybridge holiday inn I (my wife) We Would Never step foot back here again why you employ people like this.  I will be talking to creation card who is part of Barclays Bank to find out if they have a different reward card with a different hotel group altogether why pay £99 to be treated like this, You may take £10.000 a night from Rolling Stones Weekend to our £348 for 3 night stay.  And then laugh about it in a jovial manner.   It’s a shame your staff was being jovial about my wife in manner which is not acceptable behaviour,  she heard them from the lobby. I know you will hit back at me probably trying to point out it was all my fault,  either by TripAdvisor or privately in an email.  I think you need to go on training course on how to treat all your guess correctly.   Maybe it was not intentional but I think you should learn to treat disabled customers with the upmost respect Nikolai.    We booked this stay after I had open surgery 3 months ago, after all what gone on in my life and my wife life.

The location was great. Located just around corner from Stratford tube station, whilst being walking distance from the London Stadium and Olympic village. The hotel is also within Westfields shopping centre which is excellent. Our room was perfect and neither of us could fault it. It was a good size with a hairdryer, cooking utensils, lots of mirrors, a mini fridge, a good shower, plenty of towels  and decorated to a really high standard. Breakfast is also included and it was lovely. Lots of choice, including lots of juice and self-serve pancakes, with continental and bacon, sausages and a fridge full of a huge range of juices (Tropicana). In addition to this the view from breakfast was lovely, looking out over the city. You can see he O2, the Olympic stadium etc. Finally, the staff were really friendly, chatty and helpful. On checkout they were more than happy to hold our bags for us, free of charge, so we could go and do some shopping!

Trains to Stratford were all in time and the hotel was easy to find. Easiest way is over the footbridge and follow your nose.Go to the 12th floor to check in.If you come later in the day, skip the hotel restaurant in the Holiday Inn as it’s not that great and very expensive. Lots of restaurant near by and don’t be afraid to get on a tube and go anywhere in London as it’s so easy to get to.Room was great! Clean and equipped with a small kitchen, and comfy bed. Grocery store nearby and a shopping mall and casino if you are into that sort of thing.“Full English” Breakfast on the 12th floor reception area is well with going for, although it can get busy so be a little patient. Good coffee and tea and sparkling water available 24/7 for free and comes with a great view.While some of the staff were great, some were less than helpful and the check out experience was a totally missed opportunity to have us come back. IHG’s mission statement would be worth sharing with the front desk staff as it is a good one and if lived might generate lots more repeat customers.All that said, great all round experience if you are looking for a clean, safe, comfortable hotel experience.",June 2018,4.0,25,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

I found the accommodation to be in excellent order and the location is perfect for Canary Wharf. There is a nearby Waitrose and Marks and Spencer and plenty of bars and restaurants. You are a few minutes walk from the mainline rail, tube or dockland light railways. The service in the hotel for breakfast and evening socials was excellent.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Filmmaker_AR,Home away from home...,"...well that's what the IH group pf hotels intended for this property, and they're not far off. From the decor, to the food, amenities, staff and last but not least, the Social Evenings which for 3 nights a week included snacks, soft drinks as well as alcoholic beverages like lager and a selection of wines. Hearty breakfast aside, if you decide not to use the kitchen to cook, there are numerous eateries on your doorstep. Westfield shopping mall is situated right in front of the entrance.The TV in your room has connectivity with Apple Air but you'll find yourself tempted to visit the Vue cinema once in a while, then the bars knowing you don't require a designated driver to walk you to bed! How convenient. And if you didn't feel like stepping outside the building, the Holiday Inn, also part of the IH group, is located 3 floors below (you'd need to descend to the ground floor lobby to use a different elevator to access its reception) and has a Bar and Restaurant on the third floor. For smokers, designated smoking areas are either outside in front of the building or on  the third floor balcony of the Holiday Inn. Food and beverages can be charged to your room which is convenient in case you've forgotten to bring your wallet or purse with you. Note: expenses when charged to your room account/bill attracts Reward Points.Teas and coffees are complimentary throughout the day in the lounge area which also has a designated TV room at the back that is sometimes hired out for private events/meetings.The gym is adjacent to the laundry room which has an observation glass in between. Equipment is adequate however due to limited space there is no bench press or free-weights. Fortunately guests residing at Staybridge are able to access the Holiday Inn's gym on the third floor necessitating using the lifts again via the ground floor. The Holiday Inn's gym is situated next to its treatment rooms which I found to be very hygienic. I booked a Sports massage and received a very satisfying treatment by a qualified masseuse. Treatments had to be paid for by cash or card separately at Holiday Inn.The gym in Staybridge overlooks West Ham stadium whereas Holiday Inn's gym is facing Westfield mall.The breakfast buffet was quite comprehensive. I found it a challenge to resist a heavy breakfast at times, tempted with desserts that meant having to spend more time in the gym, which itself is tricky if you wake up late and don't want to miss breakfast. Fortunately trays are provided for guests to help themselves to breakfast in their rooms. I did find myself doing this a few times so I could finish my exercise followed by a late breakfast. As well as a fridge there is a microwave included in your kitchen plus an oven and hob if you decide to reheat the food...or indeed cook...which I did on one occasion with food purchased from the vegetable and poultry section in the nearby supermarket. Delish...but I digress.We were booked in a suite which included a separate double bedroom with a spacious ensuite bathroom. Both rooms included a TV. Separating the kitchen and lounge is a practical workdesk with power-points, handy when you're working with your laptop. The rooms are well furnished. For a change of scenery or if you're meeting anyone, a stroll up to the lounge can be useful. Wifi is available throughout the building.The Staybridge Stratford is overall a good property. Areas of improvement could be advance warning of Exit routes as it can be quite disorienting during alarm activation of knowing which way to go if you're at the opposite end of the main elevators...speaking of which, if you are allocated a room further away from the lifts, then the walk can feel tedious.Parking is available underground but needs to be paid for as this is not part of the hotel. Overall I enjoyed my time at Staybridge. It's location is ideal being close to transport links, shops and restaurants and above all staff were very welcoming.",December 2017,4.0,196,Traveled on business,-1,-1,-1,4.0,4.0,4.0

However, it’s right next to a major shopping mall with a really decent food court, Waitrose, and a Marks and Sparks.  Good sized rooms with windows that really open.  Proper kitchen facilities and dishwasher aimed at people on longer stays.  Nothing like fresh air to cheer you up rain or shine.  If you can’t get a booking then you can try the Holiday Inn next door until there’s a vacancy but the rooms are smaller and the windows are firmly shut.

The rail links are great. upon entering the hotel we were given a warm welcome from Sal, who directed us to the lift to reception.  We were warmly greeted as guests of the day and were given a prompt and thorough check in delivered with great personality and smiles from Mariana? And Anna, who both made a great impression and continued to be very accommodating throughout the early evening in the very well appointed self service style Bar/pantry/ breakfast area, where you are made to feel right at home.  As we entered our room, 1125,  we were extremely impressed wth the size, immaculate condition and how well it has been finished and appointed throughout, perfect!  On top of this we were greeted with a bed covered in roses wth accompanying towel swans/chocolate and wine, these small but important touches certainly helped my husband points on valentine's Day.  This combined with the exceptional service with personality was critical to going the extra mile, the team at Staybridge certainly love and breath this.  We then enjoyed drinks and nibbles at the bar before retiring for an excellent sleep on a very comfy mattress in a well air conditioned room.  Breakfast was great,  enchanting setting with a homely feel and great views over the London skyline, full and continental option available.  Check out at 12 was brilliant, the ladies were very engaging, their name's escape me as i may have been suffering from dehydration ;) but they delivered 1st class service with 5 star smile and left me smiling.

Very spacious well equipped and with a bath and shower in the ensuite. Being on the 12th floor the views were impressive but due to the aspect we couldn’t see any of London’s iconic landmarks (you may get this on the other side) We had breakfast in the morning which had a vast array of food to choose from and took it back to our room, though the restaurant area was very pleasant, spacious and again with amazing views (12th floor again). We checked out and this time it was Maria’s turn to represent the company and again she was a credit to them.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Alexandra H,Excellent facilities and helpful staff,"I stayed four nights at the Staybridge Suites, Stratford. I booked a studio suite which has a more than adequate floor space for a single person and I would not have felt cramped if staying with my partner.Great layout, the door to the corridor open into the kitchen area, meaning when in the sleeping area you could not hear anyone on the corridor outside. The kitchen was a great size, well equipped with nice touches such as a non stick frying pan, after all who wants to buy a bottle of oil just for a couple of nights stay? Plenty of crockery, cutlery and glassware. A whole selection of cooking utensils, a combination microwave/grill, hob, dishwasher, coffee pod machine and even tea towels, kitchen roll, washing up liquid and dishwasher tablets.The bedroom area was spacious with plenty of hanging space and hangers, ironing board (although the iron wasn't great). Bed and pillows were the comfiest I have experienced in a hotel for a good while. Room temperature was perfect and I had no need to alter it, in fact I didn't even look for the thermostat, again unusual when staying away from home. The bathroom had a huge shower cubical and plenty of storage space. Basic toiletries were provided (soap, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner). Unexpected room servicing every day, however the whole suite and hotel was exceptionally clean and tidy. The reception/lounge area in the main hotel was a lovely surprise with free tea and coffee available all day and a great view over Stratford City. The evening social hour was another vey welcome surprise with free wine and a selection of snacks and gave me the opportunity to relax with colleagues some evenings.Breakfast choices were good, fresh fruit, yoghurt, porridge, toast, pastries, cheese, cereals and a selection of hot food and paper takeaway bags were provided for those in too much of a rush to eat at the hotel.My only problem was an issue with connection to the wifi, multiple members of staff attempted to help with no avail and unfortunately the company they use to provide IT support were not at all helpful, one evening we made six attempts to speak to someone about the issue and they cut us off. The staff at the apartments could not have been more sympathetic and apologetic and this was an issue that was out of their control.I am so pleased I tried the suites out on this trip, I will definitely be back, the best serviced apartments I have stayed in to date.",January 2018,5.0,7,Traveled on business,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,kristen_bolt,A lovely birthday present,"My husband and I stayed at Staybridge Suites Stratford from December 22nd-January 2nd. Stratford is located in and around a shopping plaza called Westfield. Westfield and the hotel is a 36 min tube (train/underground) ride to Hyde Park. You can get there by the tube, taxi, uber, and bus. Because you are surrounded by a mall, you have access to many restaurants and several grocery stores. The hotel comes equipped with a stovetop, microwave, fridge, sink,dishwasher, counter space, and the basics needed if you are wanting to make a basic meal or heat up leftovers.Check in was quick and easy, as I had already paid for my room in advance on hotels.com. The concierge was very nice and helpful as we entered the hotel he gathered our luggage together and brought it up to us in our room. The hotel seems small when you first enter, but is quite spacious. The lobby has seating, a business center, snacks to buy, and is where breakfast is served in the morning.The room was nice, with a comfortable bed, good size bathroom, and amazing view of the city.  Because it was Christmas time and some places were closed for the holiday, we enjoyed time in our room. We bought some food from Marks and Spencer and didn't even turn the t.v on that day. We ordered room service a few times and what we ordered was very nice. It came exactly how we wanted, was warm or cold when it needed to be, and was a decent price based on the amount of food you received. One place that this hotel shines is in their breakfast. Lots of seating, tons of options, and friendly and accommodating staff. I am a vegetarian and just had to ask and they would make me Linda McCartney sausage to go with my breakfast every morning. The options available for breakfast were incredible. Pancakes, eggs, beans, hash browns, mushrooms. bacon, sausage, cereals, toast, bagels, muesli, porridge, yogurt, fruit, juices, milk, etc. If you can, make sure you take advantage of this amazing breakfast. Yum! I felt safe at this hotel, and had so many options for shopping and eating, that you could practically just stay there the entire time. Of course we wanted to do some sightseeing, so we used our oyster cards which we bought with a London Pass and would head into central London every day. You can get the Jubilee and Central lines into/from central London at this station. From the hotel you take the stairs, escalator, or elevator to the ground level and you can get the tube right there. There are also many bus options available on the other side of the mall, or taxi's are usually waiting right there as well. The tube takes roughly 36 min to get into central London. The bus takes around one hour and fifteen minutes, taxi's/ubers can do it in round nineteen minutes, but plan on it taking longer. Average cost in a black cab from Hyde Park to the mall entrance/tube entrance is roughly 40-45 pounds. If you are in a wheelchair, have the cab driver take you around to Hitchcock Ln and you will have a flat entrance without having to wait on the elevator.  Also keep in mind-when telling the driver that you want taken to Westfield Mall-there is more than one. So be sure that you say in Stratford City. The hotel can arrange a lift for you. Just speak with the concierge and they can set something up at a flat rate. We had a ride to St. Pancras station and to Heathrow. This hotel is really amazing. If I had to name one downside--and it really only has one in my opinion--is that it takes a while to get into central London. My husband and I enjoy the tube, so it was not a big deal to us at all. Again, the room was nice, staff was amazing, and breakfast was amazing. The mall gives you so many options for food and shopping, if you are going to London to shop and eat---definitely look into this hotel. Ps. On Christmas Day we received a card under our door from the staff wishing us a Happy Christmas. It was a nice touch. Whether you celebrate it or not, it is the thought behind it that was really endearing.",December 2017,5.0,1,Traveled as a couple,5.0,-1,5.0,5.0,-1,-1

The hotel isn't well signposted from the car park however we discovered that parking in row 107 in carpark B was ideal. Once we got to the top floor of the hotel and entered the reception, we found it to be very welcoming and homely. Receptionist was very friendly and explained everything including the free hot drinks in the kitchen at any time. The hotel has a complimentary laundry should you require And has a very good 'chillout' zone with games and books (to be enjoyed with a complimentary cuppa) Rooms were generous with a kitchenette and expected amenities. We did have issues with the heating as it wasn't heating the room up at all and when we switched off the heating... the room actually heated up. Would have liked an extra blanket / pillows to be stored in the wardrobes. Breakfast was a basic spread with a fancy pancake maker and fizzy drinks (*who would dare*) A lovely touch was that the hotel placed a personalised Xmas card on the Christmas Tree which was a nice gesture. Did use the laundrette and found that the dryer wasn't very good at drying and took 3 attempts. However was ok. Overall a good experience and would definitely book again if in the area.",December 2017,4.0,23,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The staff were extra nice, warm and friendly (possibly due to the festive season). The environment is clean, the room was cosy and comfortable. The bathroom a little small but nice, it has a shower not a bath, so if you are planning for a soak, look elsewhere.  You nee£ to go with your own bedroom slipper as they don’t have any complimentary ones. The kitchen was quite equipped with pots, fry pan ,kitchen roll, washing up liquid etc. The fridge is a fairly good size and you have a 2 electric burner. You also have a microwave/oven/grill combo. I particularly enjoyed the Nespresso machine which has 4 complimentary pods. We had complimentary breakfast with a fair variety. Basic really. Limited hot options. Great view from the 12ft floor while enjoying your meal. Rates ranges between £120-140 for a studio apartment. On website was showing £82 which excludes Vat. Overall, good value for money.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,anp00l,Terrible Service Overrated 4 star hotel,"We stayed here as a couple and the service was terrible. There is clearly no communication between the hotel housekeeping department and the front of the house. I sent my laundry on the 22nd December and was hoping to collect it on the 23rd December @1900 hrs (as stated in the paper) so that I will be able to check out early the next morning. However, as I waited from 1900 hrs till 2350 hrs, nothing came. I was told by the front staff that the housekeeping usually keeps the laundry in the room and that they have no access to the housekeeping rooms that keeps my laundry till the next day when they come back again.I waited till 1100 hrs the next morning for the laundry to arrive but yet it is still not here. Hence, I called the front office again and they asked me to go up to collect it from them instead. I went up and was attended by Andre' and he REPLIED THE SAME THING: TO WAIT FOR MY LAUNDRY IN THE ROOM. WHAT KIND OF 4 STAR HOTEL ASKS THEIR GUESTS TO COLLECT THEIR OWN LAUNDRY? I had no choice but to feel angry and betrayed as I was asked to go up to collect it myself. In addition, Andre' is very rude and he just brushes me off like I am one of his subordinates. Apparently, the blonde front of office staff whom I did not manage to get her name do not communicate the information to Andre' hence he has no idea what transpired in the phone conversation. That doesn't give Andre' a reason to be condescending in his tone with me especially since it is Xmas eve.For the same amount of money, you can get a smaller hotel room BUT WITH BETTER SERVICE in central London.The hotel is a 4 star hotel yet it does not have basic amenities such as a business centre for the guests to print out itineraries for their tour. When asked, front of office staff asked me to send the document to guestservices and they will print the document to me. When I sent it over, they told me that they cannot open the file.They had to direct me to Level 3, Holiday Inn to print it out. Just to let you know, Holiday Inn and Staybridge Suites are in the same building but different lifts access the hotels. Therefore, I had to take the lift to the Ground floor, change lifts and proceed to Level 3 to Holiday Inn to print a document. Staybridge Suites is known to have a well stocked pantry where they overcharge their guests for simple treats like Coke, cup noodles and biscuits. However, the only thing that they don't have is ICE. Apparently the ice machine broke down since the end of November yet nothing has been done till Xmas. Therefore, I would strongly recommend for guests to avoid this hotel as it is getting too complacent after all the wonderful reviews put up here. I have been staying annually in this hotel since the London Olympics and the service had been impeccable till I arrived this year.",December 2017,2.0,2,Traveled as a couple,-1,5.0,-1,2.0,-1,3.0

I understand that this is organised every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, so we were sorry only to have been able to take advantage onceOur only gripe was that the pillows were too hard for us, but this is a personal taste and those supplied were of a good quality. We asked for replacements for the 2nd and 3rd nights but these were not much better, I have been assured that they will remedy this on future visits. The matter was well dealt with on check out.We were on the 8th floor ( the lowest) but well away from the lift as requested , sadly, the guests above us were noisy- not the hotels fault..Despite the pillows I would have no hesitation in staying again and have given a 5* rating.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Margie N,Fantastic Hotel in an Amazing Location,"The hotel is located in a fantastic location. Even though the hotel is located in the East of London, it is conveniently located a mere 400m from Stratford Station, which is connected to the Jubilee Line and Central Line, as well as the Overground. This makes it easy to travel to Central London for the day. Additionally, as the hotel is essentially located within Westfield Stratford City, a massive shopping centre, it is also easy to spend the day shopping a stone's throw away from your room without having to step foot in Central London at all. Not only this, but it is also an easy walk to the Olympic Park, West Ham's home stadium, as well as the Aquatic Centre, all of which are attractions that was easy to visit while we were staying there. As for the hotel itself, the staff were fantastic and went above and beyond to make their customers feel welcome. My mum and my aunts flew in from Singapore and reached the hotel at around 8am, while I joined them much later. Upon my mum and aunts reaching the hotel, the staff were attentive, and as the rooms were not yet available, and seeing that they were tired, offered all three of them a complimentary breakfast at the restaurant, seeing as they could tell that my mum and aunts had taken a long flight and were tired. This made their first day in London so much better as they were able to recharge, and explore the city with much more energy. The free breakfast that came with the rooms was also excellent, serving a wide variety of cooked items, and cereals and yoghurt, with some items being changed daily. There was also a pancake making machine that made fresh pancakes with a mere push of a button, and the pancakes made were delicious too! The rooms that we were given were also fantastic, and had a great view of the East of London, and came with tea making facilities, and coffee in the form of a Nespresso machine. The rooms also included a small kitchenette that was fully equipped with cooking utensils that one could use to make a proper meal during their stay. While we did not use the kitchenette, the stay couldn't be more enjoyable.

That was maddening throughout the five weeks, I had to pin Postits to my towels begging the staff not to wash them after one shower, but no the planet died a little more, as towels were replaced in military style whether I wanted clean ones or not.  Frustrating.So a narrow win for the Holiday Inn over their Staybridge Suites sister next door.

We stayed one night 10th Sept. On arrival to check in, the reception was impressive. Checking went slowly as I think we were seen to by a new member of staff. I requested if there was a chance of late checkout and she replied the hotel was busy so check back in an hour. I mentioned it was my husband's birthday weekend but she didn't seem inspired enough to ask a senior colleague for assistance to see what could be done. So I was a tad miffed with her lack lustre approach.We got to the room, which contained the comforts of home. Microwave, dishwasher etc but I was surprised at first to size of the room. The pictures within Bookings. Com made it appear larger than what it was. The room was was clean with a view of the cinema and city. The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept really well. The shower was superb.The only issue I had was the fact I had mentioned on Booking.com that it was my husbands birthday. Which you assumed they would share with the hotel. I spoke to another member of the reception team. A friendly young man, I wish I had taken his name as he was wonderful. I explained the scenarios of no late check out and no extras in the room etc. He instantly applied a late check out to our booking and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine, apologised for the inefficiency of Booking.com and even looked towards changing the room but the hotel was fully booked.Checked out today and updated  Georgina Chifu with our experience. She was fantastic and presented my husband with another bottle of wine. She advised we contact the hotel direct for special occasions, as they take pride in making a fuss of their guests.I do have two rooms booked for my 50 th birthday in Jan. So I will ensure the hotel is advised directly. Booking.com almost ruined what turned out to be a fabulous time, thanks to  the young man on reception yesterday evening and Georgina on checking out. They have a fantastic professional approach.The breakfast was fabulous too. So many choices of cereals, cooked or fresh fruit.

If you plan to use the laundry (always on the 12 floor) remember you can buy cheap cubes of laundry soap for one or two pounds the pair. Just pop these in their washing machines, choose the program and job done.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Andy B,It's all about the customer experience,"I have stayed a lot of generic hotels up and down the country, and quite a few in Stratford (East London).  On this occasion I chose to try out the Staybridge (personal recommendation).Being a business trip, the hotel selection is based on; location, price and availability.  This time the Staybridge ticked all three boxes.  Knowing that the hotel (or should it be called an apart hotel) caters for clients usually staying for longer periods I didn't really know what to expect.Well... 'First Impressions Count' as they say and this time they did just that.  I was greeted very warmly when I arrived at about 9:30 in the morning to ask if I could leave my bag with them for my stay that night.  To my surprise I was asked if I would like to leave it in the room as it was ready.  After completing the formalities I was given the key and directed to the room (not expecting to have access to my room until the afternoon it was a great start).When I got to the room, I was impressed with the facilities on offer.  Not only was the room larger than your standard generic mid priced hotel room, but it was fitted out with a little kitchenette area.  Normally this would be ideal for preparing a ready meal to was down with a bottle of something, but on this occasion I had other plans so I can't vouch for the functionality if the appliances but I'm sure they're all good.Anyway, what I did use was all good;Bathroom - very clean and well equippedBed - very comfortable (and big)TV - what can you say lots of channelsInternet - the free wifi is more than adequate for watching films on YouTube, a bit of surfing and checking your emails.  So there is no need to by the premium pack.Coffee making facilities- a good selection of premium coffees As I said in the title, 'It's All About The Customer Experience'.  You can have a problem at any hotel but it's not the issue that you remember it how it is handled by the staff!  While I was just dropping off to sleep, I was awoken by the sound of dripping water.  After switching the light on, I discovered that water was dripping from the ceiling onto the bed.  After a quick call to reception a member of staff came to investigate.  He was quickly followed by the Duty Manager who immediately took control of the situation and arranged for another room to be made available.  I was compensated for my inconvenience and also given a late checkout if I needed it up until 2:00pm.  It turned out that the sprinkler pipe in the ceiling had sprung a leak, not a common problem I'm sure (or they wouldn't stay in business very long).  Going back to the title of this review, it shows that even if something goes wrong, if it is handled the right way it doesn't become a problem!  Because of the way the staff (even those who weren't involved with the nighttime events), treated me... as a valued and respected customer, the Staybridge will be my first choice net time I'm stopping over in Stratford.",August 2017,5.0,13,Traveled on business,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

How about a combination of both?,"Just stayed for the second time at Staybridge Suites, Westfield, Stratford, London. So you can see we're getting to like them !! In terms of location, you're slap bang in the middle of one of the greatest retail therapy areas in the UK. Near to the Olympic park. Train and bus connections for swift access to central London. The suite itself is a mini apartment. We have used both a studio suite and a one-bedroom suite. The only difference between the 2 being that the studio suite is like a spacious bedsit with kitchenette off, whilst the other has a separate room for the bedroom. Neither is cramped but open and airy. In both types, the kitchenette is fully equipped with all the crockery and cutlery that you would need, microwave, cooking hob, fridge, dishwasher, kettle, coffee maker, toaster and sink. Tea towels and the usual kitchen cleaning accoutrements including dishwasher tablets. But you don't have to stack it yourself as the service personnel will do it for you ! The suites are well furnished to sleep, eat, relax etc. Bed really comfortable. Plenty of towels, including face flannel. Quality bathing/washing shampoo, soap etc. Iron and board. Free effective wi-fi. Digital secure safe. Price wise we found that our stays compared favourably with good London hotels, Sundays and weekdays obviously being cheaper than week-ends but longer stays are rewarded. The staff are superb, efficient and well-trained. Free breakfast is included in the price - a good English and continental buffet.",June 2017,5.0,18,Traveled as a couple,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,ChorltonDragon,"Great hotel, one minor niggle","We stayed here for three nights on a long weekend visit to London. We had a one bedroom suite which was immaculate and included all the comforts of home that you could reasonably want - including a dishwasher and a fridge. The bed was comfortable and the extra pillows I requested via the website were waiting for us when we arrived. On a warm and humid weekend, we appreciated the effective air conditioning.I'd also like to especially compliment the reception staff (actually, pretty much all the staff we met but reception in particular) on their friendliness and helpfulness. They are a credit to this hotel and made us feel very welcome.Inexplicably, however, despite how great everything else about the hotel is, we found the breakfast, which was included in our room rate, to be quite poor. Many breakfast items were of poor quality, especially the hot food (and particularly the scrambled eggs which can best be described as ""grim""). There is a machine which serves fresh pancakes or, more accurately, takes ages to deliver tiny discs of rubber masquerading as pancakes. Even the coffee was bitter as though it had been scorched by too hot water. On our final morning at the hotel we didn't even bother with breakfast because the previous two days were so disappointing.To put things into perspective, we would definitely stay here again. The location turned out to be surprisingly convenient with easy parking, plenty of shops and restaurants and good access to the city centre. The room was lovely as were the staff. Even the price was reasonable by London standards.But we'll probably skip breakfast!",June 2017,4.0,53,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

On arrival we were greeted by security downstairs who told us to use the lifts on the left hand side to go up to reception - these lifts are actually for the Holiday Inn part of the building so for the Staybridge Suites you need to use the lifts on the right as soon as you enter the lobby and go up to level 12.ReceptionWe were greeted by Gregorio (apologies if I have the name wrong) who was extremely friendly and informative.  He told us everything we needed to know about the hotel and showed a genuine interest in why we had come to London for the weekend.The reception area has plenty of comfortable seats and tables and leads to the breakfast area which is at the end of the large room.  As far as we could see there was no bar area at this hotel however in reception there are fridges with alcoholic drinks in and you can help yourself (charged to room) and sit in the reception area which also has a small roof terrace.  Tea and coffee are complimentary and you help yourself from the breakfast area.In the same area in reception where the fridges are you can also purchase a variety of food and other drinks.The whole area has a lovely homely feel and is absolutely spotless.RoomWe stayed in a room with a small kitchen which was very well equipped.  This included a small hob, microwave, toaster, fridge and all cutlery and pans etc.]The main room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  Everything worked well in the room, TV Shower etc and the bed was comfortable.The room was lovely and quiet and we didn't have any issues with noise.There is free Wifi which you have to log into once you have your room number.BreakfastBreakfast was really nice and had a wide variety of options.

The food available while we were there ranged from full cooked breakfast, continental, cereals, toast, pancakes, fresh fruit and yoghurt, breads and cheese.The hotel is located right next door to the Westfield Shopping Centre and there are plenty of bars and restaurants here to visit.I really couldn't fault this hotel and would definitely stay here again.  The staff here really are a credit to the hotel as they are all really friendly and helpful.We asked for some fresh towels after deciding to keep the ones we had and use them again but they wouldn't dry properly - New towels appeared within 20 minutes, really pleased.

Paid wifi speed (5£/24 hours or 25£/week) is download 8.5 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps. The good thing is, the speed is stable. I have tested in the afternoon, as well as in the evening. Always got 8 Mbps DOWN.Keep this in mind, if you need to do some bandwidth intense working during your stay.With free wifi, even surfing on google maps in a pure pain! My recommendation to the hotel is, to increase the free wifi speed to 3 Mbps at least to be up to date...And if the hotel ads is tell me, that ""premium highspeed"" will cost me 5£ a day, I would expect DOWN & UP at least 20 Mbps.",May 2017,4.0,54,Traveled on business,-1,5.0,-1,5.0,5.0,-1

The only negative was that the plug of the bath fell off, but this was not a problem at all, and staff were attentive to resolve the issue. Shame I couldn't stay for longer.

Check in was very pleasant and easy. Room overlooked the Olympic park and West Ham United Ground - we was on the 11th floor. Lovely kitchen area, sleeping area and the shower was amazing. However, there was an half empty bottle of water under the bed and biro on the sheets. Both nights we was woken by a loud banging noise, lasted about half an hour but went as quick as it started. Breakfast is just ok, Luke warm but plenty of choice and like the idea of self service. This hotel has really friendly staff and very central for the shopping centre and pubs and restaurants.

You can also park your car in the shopping centre at very reasonable price <£10 a night. The lift to reception is a bit tricky to find but once you get there there is never a queue. The suites/ rooms are incredibly spacey for London with great views over The old Olympic stadium and Canary Warf. There is happy hour where you can drink some nice wine and cheese and biscuits for gratis.  Breakfast buffet is one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had.

There is also National Rail service (caught a straight train to Hertfordshire quite easily) and DLR too. And if you need to pop into Paris or Amsterdam briefly, Stratford International is right there too! If for nothing else I will stay here again and again!!!Then if you're on a shopping holiday it's a great choice to be here. Not only does Westfield Stratford City have most of the shops in London; you can get to Westfield London just by chilling on the Central line for just a few stops. Bond street, Marble Arch, Tottenham Court Road, stations will also get you very quickly to whichever end of the oh-so-famous Oxford Street you want to get to. You can literally start at Marble Arch end, walk your way down the road and get a train back ""home"" without having to go back to the same station you arrived from - again, without changing stations underground!.OK, enough on location.

The hotel is just outside of the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford and has it's own lobby area shared with the adjacent Holiday Inn. They have separate lifts and the reception for Staybridge Suites is on the top floor -- a very classy touch. We were greeted warmly and our bags were kept for us while we went out to explore the Maritime Museum as we were a little too early to check in. Although we parked in Lot A due to road closures we were still only a minute or two's walk from the hotel although Lot B is much better positioned for the hotel. There was a football match on which we hadn't anticipated and so the area was incredibly busy but we had no noise in our room from outside. As a Platinum member with IHG I normally get an upgrade but regrettably staff informed me they were fully booked, but I had asked for a room 'high up with view of Olympic Park' and they did not disappoint -- 11th floor with a delightful view of the Olympic Park and wider Docklands area, including the O2 arena. Staff were incredibly helpful, friendly, and informative. The 'pantry area' was well stocked and everything was affordable. The hotel features free self-service laundry facilities and a free hot breakfast every morning. The hot breakfast was fantastic and there was more than adequate seating. It was a help yourself situation and everything was topped regularly -- easily one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had in years, let alone for a free one! The room had mini fridge, dishwasher, microwave, hot plate, sink, and all the cutlery/dishware/kitchen equipment you could need. Room was cozy owing to the kitchen but the bathroom was huge and very well appointed. Bed was fairly comfy. Apple TV service didn't work particularly well, too laggy to actually utilise it. Wifi was good, complimentary 'premium' for IHG loyalty guests which was high-speed and easy to access for up to 5 devices. TV selection was adequate.

And when she realized someone was in the room, she did not return and never came back to clean. Upon checking with the front desk why our room was not made, I was told that we refused the services.( I did not even see the lady's face, how did I tell her that I don't need her to clean the room)  someone just popped the door open without knocking again at 8:30 in the morning.

This was to be for a birthday treat with a few surprises along the way whilst staying in the area. I like to plan ahead and get a good idea about my top three choices, using T.A and the customer feedback I have found invaluable.I hadn't actually considered somewhere like this before but having checked out it's facilities and location I was sold. I could not have been happier. Having caught our train from Euston to Stratford all via the underground we stayed warm and dry. It brought us right up into the Westfield shopping complex.It was a short walk to a conceirge service on the ground floor. We took the lift up to the hotel reception I think was the 11th floor. Our check in was smooth and quick having completed information in advance when placing our booking. Everything was so clean, with soft warming glow from good lighting throughtout the hotel and plush luxurious touches everywhere I looked very pleasing to the eye.We made our way to our room and could see from that the guests staying here they are clearly very respectful of others I could tell our stay was going to be fabulous. As we pushed the door back to our room the lamp light glow just drew us in past a kitchenette area that I'd really like in my home.It had everything we would need I was happy. Nice decor, great furniture, comfy beds, nice sized en-suite room, and the view across London and toward the Olympic park. My girlfriend was smiling this was a great choice. We quickly dropped our bags as I we had a pre-organised engagement to get to at one of the local restaurants on the  Westfield complex it was a 5 minute walk (review seperate for BUSABA to follow.)We didn't have far to go to anywhere we wanted since arriving it was perfect for us, we even planned to head into central London the day after which was only a short train ride away. It really gave us the choice for all we would need or want during our stay. We decided on one last drink before heading back to our room. We went to reception and bought a few beers which we could drink in the lounge area or even take them back to our room.It's not your conventional hotel and it was a very refreshing change. As we sat with our drinks over looking the skyline at night it was great. After which was an awesome night, great sleep to then grab a fresh, hot buffet style breakfast in the morning. So much choice, I even liked that you could either take a seat in the spacious breakfast lounge area or again you could take it back to your room. Having thoroughly enjoyed our visit, got ready, checked out and then headed into the Westfield shopping complex for some retail therapy. Excellent place, great location had everything we needed which made for a lightly packed travelling back. So pleased we'll definitely stay here again.",December 2016,5.0,"1,112",Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,-1,5.0

However this time, we were told on check in that we were allocated the best room but when I complained we were given many choices of much better rooms by another staff. I think it is unacceptable for reception staff to lie. If there is better room then those who are entitled should be upgraded. I hope the management will read this review and tell me if it is in the hotel policy to let reception staff lie. Now I will never believe what this hotel reception staff tell me.

I am guessing hotel was mainly built for the Olympics-slightly out of London main city though. Saying that, it may not be in the centre of London, this is not a problem as you can get the tube to explore the quaint city any time you wish.For people who love to shop, this is overly convenient. Exactly situated where one if the biggest & largest mall in Europe is-Westfield Stratford City. Parking space would never be a problem-the hotel has designated parking area in the mall. This is a bit tricky especially when you are using a Sat Nav. Best way is to ring the reception and they will direct if you struggle a bit like we did.The hotel is pretty new and the best part of  it is they have a pantry open 24-Hours so you can help yourself to everything, don't miss the coffee-one of the best feature! You can make yourself soecialty coffees without any cost too! For coffee lovers, this  would definitely make you smile!If your are tired from roaming around the mall and London sight seeing, the hotel have a lounge. Go sit there, grab some nibbles in the pantry and watch telly or read magazines and books.Breakfast is typical continental and full English breakfast. If you want to pass on the breakfast, restaurants are everywhere just outside or head inside the shopping mall to try the food. So many places to eat and dine, take away or if no joy-you can grab some bits in the grocery and cook yourself a lovely meal in your room.The room has a really good size, with your own kitchen and dining. Cooking utensils, plates, etc are provided. Guess what, even dish washing liquid and sponge is provided. This makes me feel like I am home.

Being a particularly difficult guest to impress, I really couldn't improve on anything I experienced on my recent 5-night stay.I was there for a bit of R&R combined with working from my laptop after surgery.  I chose the Staybridge Suites as I was a bit conscious that a ""normal"" hotel might drive me mad stuck in a small room with only a kettle to its name.The staff were all, without fail, excellent.  A couple of guys on reception really went above and beyond their duty to make sure I had everything I needed (even lending me a chair from their office as mine was a little lower than I was comfortable using at my desk!).The room (I had a 1 bed suite) was great.  Perfect to relax in with all the amenities I could have needed.  Apple TV was a nice touch too; helped with a binge-watch of a Netflix boxset from my iphone!If you're looking for a great place to stay and you're torn over the holiday inn downstairs and here, choose the Staybridge - I've stayed in both!  Every member of Holiday Inn staff need to stay in a Staybridge and experience what great service is like.I'll be back at this hotel as soon as I can find a reason to do so!

Parking cost £9.50 for 24 hours, which in a safe, secure location in london was a  bargain! Arrived at the hotel and was greeted by friendly and welcoming staff, check in was quick and simple. Got to the room which was beautiful, you get what you pay for, abundent amount of appliances, microwave, hob, dishwasher, you could stay for a week self sufficiently! The bed was clean and comfortable and even though im 6ft 3 i comfortably fitted within the bed without my feet dangling over the edge. The bathroom was also lovely with a powerful, easy to use shower. Check out was mid day so there was no rush in the morning and an all you can eat self service breakfast was included for free. We would like to give a special thanks to Hayat, who went above and beyond,  when she heard us talking about coffee in our hungover state and while we were getting our breakfast made us our drinks and found us a table by the window, making sure we were looked after without being asked or prompted. Overall great location, 2 minute walk to the nearest tube station, Westfield shopping centre on your door step.

I slept well. And this was important to me. I can't go overboard on Staybridge. I checked in at 21:00 on Friday, and back out at 07:30 on Saturday. But I needed to sleep. (Rowing competition in the morning - don't go to sleep, I'm not going to tell you about it!!)And sleep I got. Checked in easily - quick, simple, no hassle. Room was nice and high up, away from any potential noise, with a good view of that odd spiral thingy next to the stadium. Kitchen was great (I didn't use a thing) - and the Nespresso machine was a good touch - the pods gave me a proper pick me up in the morning ahead of going to my competition. Toilet was lovely! Something you'd expect in a much more expensive hotel. TV was good, remote worked, and it was loud enough in the room without setting it too loud. And the bed. Big, comfy, loads of pillows. Not too hot, not cold. I slept well. Alarm clock needed to be setup as it was unplugged, but plugging it in set the time, so I just had to use my brain to work out how to set the alarm. Check-out was quick. Maybe because I'd booked it through Expedia, but I just had to say I was checking out, and 60 seconds later I was on my way. Location wise, it was right next to the Westfield shopping place - amazing if you're into that kinda thing. Close to Olympic stadium (West Ham now?) the Aquatic centre, and the Velodrome. Sadly, I didn't get to do breakfast, but someone else i know did, and loved it. Next time I'm racing this competition, I'll stay here.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Lindsay G,Home from home at Staybridge Suites London Stratford city,"Stayed 3 nights over the ""Black Friday"" weekend. This was our first visit to a Staybridge Suites and we chose a one bedroom suite. The rate booked directly on the hotel site was very good and was actually cheaper on the Saturday night than the nearby Premier Inn! We arrived shortly after the 3pm check in to find a large queue, but the check in staff worked efficiently, so the wait was less than 5 minutes. I did ask on check in if we could have a room overlooking the Olympic park, but these had already been allocated. As it turned out, much of the views over the Olympic park are being obscured by new high rise buidings under construction. Our room on level 9 overlooked Westfields shopping mall. The suite was spacious and the kitchen provided the flexability to eat in the room. One obivious ommission in the room was the absence of a table to comfortably sit and eat at. There was a coffee table and a sort of breakfast bar, but the available chairs were slightly too low to eat comfortably from the bar. The hotel operated a policy of no maid service Saturday and Sunday (unless requested), which we were happy with. The hotel provided a complimentary breakfast and even gave guests the option to bring breakfast back on trays provided to eat in their rooms. This seemed a good idea if your room was on the same floor as the restaurant on level 12, but not very practical if you have to take a tray of food and drink to a different floor via the busy lifts as there were only two.  We loved that the hotel was within Westfields shopping Mall so that we could shop and return to our room in minutes. We went into Oxford Street on Friday evening using the Central Line tube. The journey time was about 20 minutes. On Saturday, we went for a walk around the Olympic park which has some lovely open space for residents and seems to be well utilised. Westfields has two railway stations, Stratford International and Startford City which has an integrated transport hub with rail, tube DLR and bus all avialable. On our final morning, we nearly got caught out with the early finish time for breakfast of 9.30am - this does seem a little early and appeared to have caught other guests out. As the check out was 12 noon and reception very kindly allowed us an extension to 1pm, we enjoyed a last walk around Westfields before checking out. There was a slight hick up when we returned to our room at 11:45 to find that our room key had been deactivated and I had to go up to reception to get it sorted. I could understand how that could happen if we had returned to our room after the official 12 noon check out - but not before!!

Firstly I had requested a room with a view on a higher floor and was put on a lower floor (the 8th) over looking the AC for a local casino/shopping centre  - I think this was partly to do with their central reservations department, the lady whom I spoke with didn't really understand me. I was told to go back to reception the following day and see if I could be moved. The water in the bath was regulated and set to a maximum temperature, which was not hot just very warm. On the second day I asked once again to be moved but they cold not move me to a room with a view. Then the flush in the toilet could not be flushed again within about 40-60 minutes of the first flush - which is not acceptable, so they moved me to another very similar room - again with no view. Coffee was not replenished either and I was not informed of the managers reception (which you usually are when you check in) The second room there was an extremely strong smell of cooking or body odour I am not sure but made me feel sick - I had to keep the widows opened all day and night. I was offered to move to another similar room but did not want to then re pack once again so just decided to stay put. Reading the reviews most people seem extremely delighted here, so not sure if I was just expecting more from this brand but for £250 a night I would probably go back and stay at The Westbridge next time. On a good note - the location is absolutely perfect for The Westfield shopping centre and the staff I think did try to assist were possible.",November 2016,3.0,23,Traveled on business,3.0,-1,4.0,3.0,-1,-1

As I have revised this before I will just go over any major points.  The hotel is perfect for a visit to London without being in the centre or wanting to drive.  I parked the car on both occasions easily and not expensive and then caught the bullet train into the city taking merely 15 mins.  Buffet breakfast was great as before and on the second visit my husband took the handy tray from the room and filled it up and so we had breakfast in the room for no extra cost.  The rooms and bathrooms still look brand new and modern.  Hotel staff were able to allocate me the same room both times as it was so nice and we love the kitchenettes.

Great staff!,"Perhaps my subject line said it all but I like to be abit more elaborate perhaps because I like to read elaborate and detailed reviews. We stayed here for 2 nights.Location is perfect literally on the door step of the Westfield shopping center. Lobby was clean and inviting, it extends into a quite a large sitting area. Which is tastefully decorated. Clean, welcoming and comfortable. With ample sitting area (and a balcony).There was no one at check in for a good 5 min. When someone did come they went on to present 'guest of the day' awards to 2 separate couples because aparently it was their birthday. They went on to take some photos. We waited still. Seeing as it was sort of a goodwill gesture and a happy moment I didn't mind waiting. After that check in was quick and friendly with lots of smiles from both front desk staff. Room was very clean and comfortable with the sofabed as we had 2 children.  The Cons...We woke up Saturday morning and went out for the day. Got back at 4pm and our room was not cleaned. For about £250 (i think) per night we expected our room to be cleaned by this time.  Especially since we had a brief chat to the housekeeping staff as we left the hotel that morning. After a couple of phone calls we learnt that, in fact, we didn't inform the check in staff that we wanted our room cleaned. This hotel does not have anyone to clean the rooms on the weekends  unless specified at check in or atleast 24hours previously.  Gentleman on the desk sincerely apologised for not having informed us at check in and I was happy with the way the matter was handled.  Mistakes happen.Also breakfast is free. But the selection of food could be slightly better. I understand their need to have a different menu for those that are staying there long term...but every breakfast needs baked beans! ;-) and some hot choclate for the younger ones would be nice like Holiday Inn express does.

When getting to our room saw we had been given disabled room.  This was distressing to us as we had booked weekend away as a break from caring for my terminally ill mother in law and this meant we were just reminded of this.  We contacted reception and was told that we had booked this room.  We categorically did not book a disabled room and despite arguing this fact was told we did and that everyone else had checked in and they couldn't change this.  We did eventually manage to speak to a Manager who changed our room but not without us making a fuss.  Apparently they do not clean rooms at weekends unless you request this - we did but it was not done and breakfast a shambles - no cups or glasses or cutlery - continually having to ask!

This was the warmest welcome that we have ever experienced in all our trips staying in different hotels everywhere in the world.  MD at the front desk outdid himself in welcoming us home to Staybridge. He invited us to breakfast while we waited for our room since we arrived early. He worried about the cleaning chemicals used in the room because I had asthma and allergies. He designated us as the ""Guest of the Day"" with a gift bag of goodies!The warmth did not end at the front desk but carried through everywhere and everyday. Everyone was friendly and helpful.  They smiled and greeted. Lovely Carmen from Rumania and colleagues, during the free evening receptions on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, ensured that we had our wines, beers, and soft drinks refilled. They laid out the cheese trays, breads, crackers, chips, vegetables, hummus, and salsas and encouraged us to eat. Breakfasts were ample, generous, and replenished continually. All kinds of eggs, stewed tomatoes, mushrooms, potatoes, bangers, and bacon were the hot dishes. A pancake machine fascinated the kids and adults. A huge cauldron of oatmeal, various cereals, and yogurt with different toppings like nuts, raisins, currants, cherries, and banana chips were available. There was a big variety of breads, bagels, and muffins to satisfy the fussiest eater. Coffee of different types, tea, juices, and milk were the order of the day. I felt so spoilt by the choices and ate far too much every day.The suite was immaculate and cleaned very well every day except on the weekends. Our spacious bathroom was spotless. The kitchennete in our suite was also very tidy and clean with new-looking plates and cups and granite counter.Location. Staybridge Suites is above Holiday Inn and the entire building sits right on top of Westfield Shopping Center. This is a modern and large shopping mall anchored by Marks and Spencer, Waitrose supermarket, John Lewis, Primark, Boots, WHSmith, and Ikea. There are also many eateries from McDonalds to higher-end restaurants. The food court offers a fabulous variety of food.  Several bars serve wine, beer, and other alcohol.Stratford City is industrialized and modern.  Skyscrapers, unfinished apartment buildings, and cranes dominate.  Cute little English houses, small villages, and historic buildings are absent.  I missed them while staying here.Staybridge Suites is connected to the Underground/subway, busses, and trains. Getting to and from Heathrow Airport is not a problem unless you have lots of luggage because of the stairways in the Underground.  The subways run all day long.Going into Central London where the tourist sites are located is slightly more difficult.  You have to change/switch trains/lines. It is not as easy as staying in Central London where you can walk almost everywhere.  Therefore, familiarize yourself with the Underground and how it works.  Use the Underground after commuter hours in the mornings and evenings when the trains are less crowded.  Otherwise, you will be squished or smelling someone's armpit!This is an American hotel.  Everything is done well.  Everything is big.  The 12th floor lobby has balconies, a library, nooks, and crannies to sit, work, socialize, and have a complimentary cuppa tea or coffee twenty-four hours.  Comfortable sofas and chairs beckon.  The laundry room and gym are on this floor too.  The washing machines and dryers are free.  Yippee!We have stayed here for 11 nights already and will depart for home in another two days. It has been such a great stay that I was moved to write the review before I forgot the details.In terms of hospitality, the hotel industry could learn a thing or two from this particular Staybridge.  As they say here, ""Welcome Home"" to each guest, I truly felt at home.  Thank you, Staybridge staff for making us feel at home, especially, when we are an ocean away from our own home.

We used the Overground and DLR to visit Greenwich and Clapton/Hackney during our stay, which meant we could leave the car alone for the weekend.Good points:+ Very reasonably priced rooms/suites and car parking+ Good breakfast selection and great views from the communal areas on the 10th floor+ Friendly and helpful staff+ Ready access to Stratford station for rail, bus and overground/underground Not so good points:- Staybridge suites don't fit locks to their bathroom doors, which I find really odd and may worry guests who don't want surprise visits from housekeeping while they are using the bathroom- The plaza area around the hotel's entrance can get noisy at night (partly due to nearby bars), this could be intimidating for some guests",October 2016,4.0,780,Traveled as a couple,4.0,-1,-1,5.0,-1,4.0

Upon arrival I was made to feel completely at home starting with the concierge. By the time I got to the reception desk I got the impression that all the staff has been trained to please their guests and make them comfortable.The room was as seen on the internet - comfortable, spacious and well laid out. My requests to be near to the elevator was granted - couldn't be any closer. I was on the 9th floor facing the city and loved it. Lots of sunlight and movement, trains, buses, people, etc. etc.. Excellent WiFi service - never a problem.  Was able to use my electronic devices from the moment I checked in - any hour of the day or night. GREAT!!!!!Excellent location as I could walk to the Stratford tube and bus terminal, not to mention browsing the mall and being able to get anything I needed right their, just a short walk away. Never had to worry about what to eat....lots of restaurants outside the lobby entrance in the mall and the food court in the mall offered many choices for a meal. Tea and coffee is always available 24 hours a day and the snack bar ensured you could get something to snack on all day/night.  Breakfast was very appealing and quite a variety - GOOD JOB.Very impressed with: the physical layout of the hotel; the warm friendly greeting from the hotel staff (calling me by my name) every time they saw me; the kitchen with a microwave, stainless steel kettle, toaster, dishwasher, fridge, safe, dishes, pots and pans all made my stay stress free and easier to cope. The hotel, rooms and amenities were always clean and the housekeepers did an excellent job keeping my room chemical free - thank you. This is not just an hotel it has a homely feel to it.  Also loved the way each staff member tried to accommodate my requests, especially  MD and Natalia.  MD was extremely helpful, professional and caring. MD made a world of difference to my stay because he walked the extra mile every time there was a need and even when there was no need. I thank you for your help in making my room change possible, timely and stress free. Because of you I will come back to Staybridge Suites Stratford. Natalia, thanks for printing my etickets and documents..you were so patient.kind and professional.  Gregarrio (?) I love your enthusiasm and eagerness to please - don't lose that.Liked the fact that I could speak to the Manager, Nicolas when there was an issue and he was quite understanding and had a good sense of what was happening. Thank you. It made a difference.Experienced some stress when the football game was on at the Arena. The entrance to the mall and hotel was closed off and I was not told about this.As a result, it was very stressful trying to get back to the hotel the night of the game.  May help if the Concierge and/or reception staff advise staff of this situation and how to get around it. You can call the Concierge and they will come and get you at the gate but I was not made aware of this before the first game.Another stressful situation is the fact that most of the housekeeping staff do not speak English and that made communication limited and stressful at times. The front desk staff made up for this because they were always there - ready to help. Thanks for a wonderful stay. Glad I chose Staybridge Suites Stratford - great place to spend an extended trip.

My husband and I stayed at the Staybridge Suites for nearly 3 weeks last year and used it as our home base for travel during our vacation.  After reading all of the wonderful TripAdvisor reviews we decided to give the Staybridge Suites a go and it turned out to be a wonderful choice.  All of the staff were super friendly and welcoming.  The location is very convenient.  A short 5 minute walk and you are at the tube station for a quick trip into London and points beyond.  After playing tourist all day it was nice to be able to come back to our hotel and have a plethora of dinning choices nearby either in the Stratford City Mall or the shops surrounding the area.  The breakfast each morning included many choices and the ""hot"" items changed each day so you didn't get tired of having the same thing every day.  The king sized bed was comfortable and the room as a whole was well laid out.  The kitchen area provides the opportunity for you to prepare your own meals if you so choose complete with a dishwasher.  We also made use of the free laundry room facilities (we brought some laundry detergent pods with us).  OK, so maybe the dryers were a little inefficient at actually drying clothes, but it still worked out.Over the past year since our visit I have recommended the Staybridge Suites to many of my friends and family.

It would also be good to advise guests that there is a few hundred meters walk from the street through the Plaza towards the hotel so if they are carrying a lot of luggage, it would help to be dropped off at the Chesnut Plaza side (landmarks are The Cow and Busaba Eathai restaurants) and to call the hotel a few mins before arrival so that a bellman could meet them.",September 2016,4.0,5,Traveled with family,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Located at the Westfield Shopping Center and directly across from the Olympic Park it is was and still remains one of the best places to stay in all of London.  When I lived there the staff was incredible and they made me feel like I was part of the family.  They couldn't do enough for me and my wife and made our stay the best experience anyone could have.  In the end we made some great friends and great memories.  Roll forward 4 years later and we finally got the chance to back to London for the weekend and the only choice for us was the Staybridge Suites.  This can be a risk sometimes because you are taking a bit of a trip down nostalgia lane but in this case it was trip worth taking.  The place is absolutely fantastic!!!!  The staff are on the game and greeted us like long lost friends coming home.   The breakfasts each morning was awesome, the rooms were perfect the location of the hotel you cannot beat.   You have the Westfield Shopping center just 30 steps from the front door of the hotel and close to 200 stores to choose from.  You have the Olympic Park across the street and you have the Underground just a 5 minute walk.  It does not get any better.   If you are coming into London for a business project that requires you to stay long term...this is the only choice you want to make.  They provide pots and pans for cooking in your room, breakfast every morning and hors d' oeuvres in the evening.  They have movie nights on Monday or Tuesdays and they make the guests feel like true VIP's. When you come to London make this your stop.

The complimentary breakfast had more options than before with a multitude of cereals, hot options, pastries, bagels, even brioche!!, fruit and yoghurt, coffees, teas, juices etc. We were spoilt for choice and both my son and I are picky eaters. I think Staybridge's biggest strength remains its staff. MO at the front desk went above and beyond as usual making my son feel at home and very special. He really is in a class of his own. Sal and Marco the concierges were great. Very warm, welcoming and always happy to assist. Staybridge has ceased to feel like a hotel to us and more like a family visit because of the amazing staff.

The parking is easy and the shops are right outside the door. One thing marred our stay which is the reason why I haven't ticked the usual 5 star box, was that my son left a new very expensive shirt in the room on departure which was not recovered. We called the hotel when we arrived home to inform them and was told the room was vacant that night so it would surely be found. It wasn't. It had obviously been stolen. We realise our son is at fault for leaving it behind but a hotel as good as this should have honest staff.

Wifi is also available throughout the hotel- at no extra cost. In terms of the breakfast menu there is something for everyone and a large variety to choose from including tea/coffee, Tropicana fruit juice, cereal, pastries, fruit, yoghurt and the usual selection from a continental breakfast. The staff here are always most welcoming and approachable to assist with any queries/requests.

The bathrooms are always impeccable, housing a generous shower, as are the rooms which are cleaned to a high standard. Westfield shopping centre is accessible on the hotels doorstep and houses a mixture of high-street and high-end fashion. In terms of parking, when my partner and i visit this hotel we always tend to park within Westfields car park which houses ample secure parking and costs £6.50 for 24 hours on a weekday (hardly leaves a dent in your wallet).If you wish to venture into inner central London the Underground is easily accessible as is the DLR stations and buses.

Thebathroom  had sufficient grab rails. The shower (walk or wheel -in with large,very solid flip down seat) was easy and safe to use, with the shower spray unit itself new, in good condition and much better than many hotels we've previously experienced. Hotel Location is just yards  from the large Westfield shopping centre  and within just a few minutes walk of the Olympic park. There are are plenty  good eateries within a short distance of the ground level front entrance (no steps), so although being disabled myself and a very slow walker, those in the Chestnur Plaza, pretty much immediately outside the Staybridge entrance, were possible for me to walk to and from. Not that we tried it but our children assure us It's within a short walking distance of Stratford station and Statford international stations. We found taxis had to drop us off from the main road  at the end of Chestnut Plaza. Though they didn't tend to know exactly where Chestnut plaza is (they did all know where the Westfield centre is)  and once dropped off, there's a short walk along a 'street'  area between the numerous restaurants to get to the front door of the Staybridge Suites. Certainly no problem for a fully  able walker  though we normally used my transportable wheelchair. Our children found no problem using the Uber system to get Uber taxis to pick us up at the right point at the end of Chestnut Plaza.For somebody disabled, I'd say the hotel is suitable in an accessible room. The staff, particularly at Reception are very friendly and helpful and perhaps more importantly, efficient.

The reception staff were okay but nothing amazing the location of this hotel suited our needs for this stay but would I return probably not as there are other hotels within a ten minute tube ride that are better!

The apartment was perfect for such a stay. Compact but so much thought had gone into the best use of space. The kitchen was ideal a fridge and a dishwasher were great to have. Only minor issue was my sofa I think had been over used, by that I mean it was a little lumpy, but it was not worth complaining about.The staff that cleaned my room were very friendly and again reflected the whole staff. The fact that there was a laundry on the premises and that it was free was a again a great bonus. One would think that breakfast in the same place for 20 days would become boring, but as much as it was the same, it was different. By that I mean we had different potatoes or different eggs each day at the buffet. Fresh fruit was great as was the fresh bread and juices. I love grapefruit juice and would like to see that next time, but a choice of orange, pineapple and apple was more than adequate.Wifi was good, although it slowed at the weekend when occupancy was high.

Casino next door (tip:  sign up for the loyalty card and get 5 £ free slots and 2 free roulette spins.  )The suite had a great kitchenette (tip:  grocery store in the mall was fabulous with lots of reheat meal options and alcohol).  But it was all about the air conditioning.  They had a heat wave the week we went in June with high humidity.  Very few places, hotels or restaurants have air conditioning in the UK, it was worth staying out of London for that alone.  We could also open the window for fresh air when it cooled down.  Staff was awesome and even printed our boarding passes for us.  Tea coffee 24/7 and The breakfast buffet was the best we've had (we travel moderate priced).

So, on arrival the staff were so lovely, accommodating, helpful and genuine. The views from the lobby are gorgeous, and lounging/breakfast area is just lovely to sit in.Our rooms were outstandingly clean, modern and contained all the facilities we needed and more. We had a kitchen (that we didn't actually use) but it was immaculate and included cups, plates and cutlery. We had a complimentary Nespresso coffee machine, free wi-fi access, a glorious bathroom with shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, a widescreen TV, the most comfortable bed, full length mirror and a hairdryer. The whole feel of the place was very homely, and the welcome pack even explained that you could move the furniture around to your liking and the cleaners would leave it that way for the duration of the stay. I had a great night sleep with no disturbances.A hot and cold buffet breakfast came complimentary and I've literally never had a complimentary breakfast that's so good! I would have happily paid for it. And again, it was designed to have that 'homely' feel. You could help yourself to  a huge selection of different milk and fruit juices from a fridge, just as you would at home. There was every single cereal possible, granola, porridge, fry up, pancakes, fruit, yoghurt, etc etc. So good! You could also make your own take-away coffee at any time of the day/night.The suites are located literally within Westfield shopping centre also, so ALL the restaurants and bars you could possibly wish for are on your doorstep.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Simon F,Another great IHG hotel... Love stay bridge suites!,"My wife and I had stayed at the Vauxhall version of this brand and thought we'd try the other side of town for something different. This place is in the heart of the new development at Westfields in Stratford and right outside the Olympic park and aquatics centre used in the 2012 Olympics.  It's a 10 min walk from station into Westfield's shopping mall in the restaurant quarter. Firstly anything I say negative is really quite superficial to my overall rating as its not really the hotels fault. But the outside of the hotel now is a post olympics site as Stratford is ready to become the international business zone with lots of new high rise buildings going up. To rest assure any concerns there are no noise concerns as the glazing is first rate. IHG are really on to something with this brand of hotel for working people and holidays era who stay in London. Each room has kitchenette facilities - including a dish washer. For holiday/long vacation stayers this maybe a welcome break on the bank balance if you want to eat in one night as its well stocked with cooking utensils and crockery. Personally we never used it - and probably wouldn't unless you are staying more than a couple nights (which we didn't) The room is smaller than the large suite we stayed at in Vauxhall, but really nice, clean, King bed, excellent TV and Apple TV to AirPlay the iPad from and a high-class tea and coffee machine. Plenty of spare plugs to charge things in too. The shower/bathroom was also excellent. Power shower hit the mark. The room doesn't have a bath, which was no issue for us.Breakfast is an amazing high class buffet. Holiday inn.... Take note from a sister brand how to do breakfast well! Pancakes, full English, croissants, fresh juice, breads, muesli, fruit, porridge - the list is endless. Well done. The service is excellent checking in a out.... They really look after there guests. Special mention to MD who dealt with our checkout with such friendliness and conversation.

My partner complains about my snoring and likes a suite allowing a separate sitting room with a door. This was booked to allow us to see the olympic village and shop. Check in was overly complicated. We discovered the sofa bed had been made up which we didn't want. Because of this we were stuck in getting an extended check out. My partner is a priority guest. Check out with the guest manager was a much more pleasant experience. I get the feeling that this is a venue for working away from home. A small kitchenette in the room.

The location is almost unbeatable. A short walk from the Stratford Tube station, and equally short walk to the Stratford International station, which itself offers nonstop train service to St. Pancras. So if, like us, you are coming in from Eurostar, you are one stop and 10 minutes from your hotel as soon as you arrive.The hotel occupies the 8th through 12th floors (sister hotel Holiday Inn has the lower floors). Reception is on the 12th. Don't worry about noise from the lobby if you have a room on 12 -- they are separate. Rooms are good sized and all have a great view with no noise issues noted. Our only problem with the room was that housekeeping apparently feels a king room should only have one guest and we were never left more than one bath towel -- had to ask for more. Wifi was a bit slow.Breakfast is great (and coffee/tea/water are always available). The hotel is located at Westfield Stratford mall so there are tons of restaurants and shops immediately adjacent to the property -- one day we didn't even leave the mall!A special shout-out to Stephan.

You have won me back.  Staff are warm, friendly and genuinely want to help.  The decor is clean, modern and exceeds expectations.  The breakfast was plentiful and a variety was offered.,  We stayed for one night (wanted longer!) in a One Bedroom King Suite, and loved the space, facilities and the fact it is perfect for guests that tend to want a suite experience in a hotel.  The only comment would be that I think the concierge on the ground floor as you enter might be more engaging and wanting to help - especially during the night.  He was more interested in watching You Tube or similar than opening the doors for me at 3am in the morning! (I am a light sleeper and only sleep around four hours per night, so that is why I was awake!)  Overall recommend this property totally.  If this is the way IHG is going in the UK - GO FASTER, it is about time you were at the finish line!  It is what is says - a home away from home.

We chose to stay there as we were attending an event nearby. The accommodation is located within the Westfield Complex. This means it's easy to find, it's close to shopping, bars and restaurants and transport links. We drove there, and although the car park was very busy (not helped by the numerous bays under repair) we found the parking at the centre very cheap, less than £10 for time we were there. The Suites were located on the upper floors of the complex. Reception and our room were on the 12th floor, so away from the noise of the bars etc. Our room was very spacious, with a kitchenette,and a coffee machine. The bed was very comfy, so much so that my wife took a note of the pillows and has since purchased one similar. The view is a little spoilt by all the building work, but as soon as it's all completed it will offer panoramic views of London. We could see, Canary Wharf, the City and the Olympic Park from our room. (Ask for an even numbered room to get the same view)There was a communal area by reception, with free coffee and water 24 hours a day. Plus a selection of snacks and drinks that could be purchased 24 hours a day.  The area also served as the breakfast area in the morning, and included a separate den and balcony. There is a gym on site, which has a few machines, no treadmill surprisingly, however you can also use the facilities of the hotel next door if need be. We found the staff when we checked in very friendly and they could not do enough for us. The staff the next day, were efficient but we found them unhelpful, unfriendly,  basically they couldn't wait for us to leave! Would we stay there again. Probably.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Richard L,A really lovely 'home from home' hotel!,"With out doubt this is the nicest ‘home from home’ hotel I’ve ever stayed in. The entrance, hotel and room were spotless. The reception staff were exceptionally helpful and very eager to please. They allowed us to check in earlier than the advertised 3pm, which was a great help.The hotel is located within the Westfield Stratford City Shopping Centre and can be accessed with or without entering the Centre. Whilst it feels super safe during the day I’d be a little more on your guard during the night. My wife and I returned to the hotel at 11.40pm and Westfield Security were trying to defuse a very heated exchange getting close to blows outside the hotel entrance doors between a group of youths. It didn’t look very pleasant and we quickly got into the hotel. I guess with the bars in the area this is to be expected but not something you’d really want your kids to see if returning very late.The room was amazing. The kitchenette and bathroom were so clean. The first time I’ve ever stayed in a hotel without a ‘grungy’ shower in need of TLC. It really was immaculate. However, I would say the room needed the most minor attention to detail. Silly little things really. The strike plates on the door frames for both doors were misaligned. For the main door this meant we couldn’t deadbolt the door at night for peace of mind. To counter this maintenance has installed a ‘look-see’ latch, which is fine but the strike plate only needs a bit of fettling. Similarly the bathroom strike plate needs a small adjustment, a bend really, so the door can close smoothly. As it was I woke my wife at 6.30am using the bathroom.A hairdryer was provided but there wasn’t a single outlet near a mirror! To be able to use the hairdryer we had to rearrange the furniture moving a desk up a bit to reveal a hidden socket, moving a desk lamp to another outlet. There was a stand-up lamp located behind a really comfy chair but the switch was on the floor so every time we wanted to switch the lamp on/off we had to move the chair. As I said silly things but it felt like the room had been set out without proper thought or maybe rearrange by a previous guest?I can’t fault the complimentary hot and cold breakfast provided on the twelfth floor near reception. We managed to get a table as we were very early but there are lots of signs advising guests on weekends the breakfast area can get busy so you may wish to grab your food and head back to your room. There is tea and coffee on tap 24/7 also in the breakfast area and free WIFI. The hotel has a pantry with food to buy, fitness centre and laundry facilities but we didn’t use these.

I always love writing reviews when they are good. But, this stay was not good... it was excellent!! Our greeting at reception on the 12th floor was warm, welcoming and staff were smiling, obviously happy to be working there and checked us in very quickly. Our suite with a view over the London skyline was, well excellent! Everything you need. Spotlessly clean, microwave, fridge, hob, glasses, cutlery. No cheap coffee: an up-to-date machine. We said it was an experience like we have had in the USA where usually everything is big and service is usually very good. Breakfast was the best we have experienced in a long time. Stefan & his colleagues were friendly, down-to-earth, helpful, and the hot food was not only very good quality, but... hot ! (isn't it annoying when food is put out in hotel breakfast buffets and you find it luke warm at best?) Drinks machines excellent and loved the idea of milk in cartons, real fruit juices in cartons in a large fridge. No waste, no silly tiny glasses & jugs. Looking forward to returning!!!  Any criticisms? None. Highly recommended. Already booked to stay again in June and we are looking forward to it. I know that the selfish man who decided to break the rules and smoke in his room, won't be there. He is banned! He caused the hotel's fire alarm system to go off and we had to evacuate the hotel, after midnight. The staff were very apologetic, but they were absolutely right to follow the procedures and we weren't out in the cold for too long. Hasten to add he did not come down for breakfast - he would not have been popular.",April 2016,5.0,173,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,5.0

We could make her food for her in the kitchen and store things in the fridge, which was invaluable as she has a dairy allergy. The room was so spacious and having a separate lounge made it much nicer to watch tv, talk and relax whilst our daughter was sleeping in the bedroom. The whole room and hotel were in immaculate condition. Moving on to the breakfast, this continued to fit the home from home feeling. A fantastic selection of food and juices to enjoy and exactly the sorts of things we would enjoy on a lazy Sunday at home. Little touches like having the condiments (e.g peanut butter) in jars that you could take to your table rather than packets just added to that homely feeling.

Good breakfast and very easy access to shopping, tube and trains.  Facilities at the Holiday Inn can be used but I struggled with understand arrangements in the bar.

Also access to the many many restaurants in the mall is a huge plus and a major attraction for us to go back. The Stratford underground station is right next door and offers a reasonable connectivity to London and its various sights. The 1BR that we often booked was very spacious and perfect for long stays. It is quite well furnished with a full kitchenette, 2 TVs and anything else you may need. Free laundry was useful as we were on a long European trip. Another major plus was the huge reception area. Perfect place to sit down if you want to be outside the room and not outside the hotel. Also if you are meeting a guest. The breakfast was also quite good. It would have been better if they would change things a bit more than they do but despite this we were happy enough to eat there for a week.

Normally when we visit London we stay in a central location however this is definitely a hotel we plan to visit again due to it's close proximity to Olympic park, Westfield shopping centre (to keep my wife happy) and transport links.Once we arrived we were welcomed by 2 members of staff who were happy to assist in selecting a nice room for us as we were keen to have a nice view of the park and also London.  The room was first class with it's own kitchen.  As we only stayed 1 night we did not have a great need for the kitchen however after a busy day at the show we stopped off at the local m&s food next door to grab some food to take ""home"" just to try it out!  Having a good fridge which works well is a welcome change for a hotel.The breakfast buffet in the morning is also first rate along with the views.The lift takes a bit of getting used to as you have to use your card, just ask how to use it at reception to avoid going down to the basement each time 😀 - it is for security to avoid just anyone getting to the rooms.We took the opportunity to visit the Olympic swimming pool and Velodrome which were brilliant with free entry to both we were lucky enough to catch a swimming competition and watch some amateur cyclists have a go.  The park is very large so we also took the opportunity to try out the recently installed ""boris bikes"" which are only £2 to hire for 24hrs providing these are docked within time limits.I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a home away from home, as an HRG member it was also a bonus to learn I'd earned some points during my stay which I hope to put to good use with a return visit.5 stars",February 2016,5.0,26,Traveled with family,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The breakfast selection has something for everyone, and the socials on Tues - Thurs evenings are great.But above all, it is the staff that make a stay here extra special. They are without doubt the best team I have ever come across at a hotel and all appear to genuinely love working here which is a credit to how the hotel is run. No matter what time of day, you are greeted with a warm smile and a friendly face. They go out of their way to make you feel at home, and whether you are here for 2 days or 2 months they will do whatever they can to help make your stay perfect.

The 7-8 social hours, with free drinks and nibbles Tuesday to Thursday, the brilliant (and inclusive) ""Pantry"" breakfasts, and of course the rooms, especially the one bedroom ones are spaces, comfortable and have everything you could need.For me and my company, the Staybridge Suites (in Stratford) have become our London home from home. If we are anywhere near the East side of London (and sometimes if we are not) then that is where we will stay.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,PJholiday,Unexpected pleasure,"My wife and I, accompanied by another couple of friends, stayed at the Staybridge Suites in Westfield Stratford recently.  My wife and I were there for two nights and our friends just for one.  From the moment we got to reception the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful.  They were very courteous and professional.  We got checked in within minutes and informed that breakfast is included with the stay, where the restaurant was and anything else that we needed to know.  We then got directed to our room.The room is very clean with a small kitchen area (which contains a microwave, hob, oven etc. a kitchen away from home), and a large bathroom (for a budget hotel).  The room itself was much better than I was expecting from a hotel in this price bracket, which was a nice surprise.  The room was comfortable, as was the bed, and the shower was huge with actual water pressure, rather than the usual trickle you get from most budget hotels.You had an option (which you were given at check in) whether you wanted maid service each day during your stay (which is also included in the price).The breakfast area is on the top floor (12th) where reception is, so you do get some views of the area.  In the distance you can see Canary Wharf and the City towers, but unfortunately much of Stratford is under construction, so other than Olympic park/stadium, there is not too much to see.  The views at night are much better as it masks the construction and the skyline al lit up looks impressive.  With regards to the construction I mentioned, I will say that although it is going on, it in no way impedes your stay and you certainly can’t hear it from the hotel.The hotel is a short journey on the underground/DLR to various places around London and very handy for Westfield shopping, restaurants, bars or even the casino, if the mood takes you.  The commute from Stratford to Oxford street (which is fairly central) is only about 15 mins on the Central Line, so the location is very useful.  Another way to go, (which is what we did), is to head from Stratford to Royal Albert Dock, from there you can get the Emirates Air Line cable car over the river to the O2 Arena, and from just around the corner from there you can hop on the Thames Clipper which will take you up the river.  Nicer views than the underground even though it is a longer journey (I think in total the journey took us about an hour from when we left the hotel until we got to London Bridge).  You are also able to use Oyster cards on both the Air Line and the Clipper, so very handy.All in all, I would recommend the hotel.  It is very nice, very handy and very inexpensive for a London based hotel.  Two thumbs up!",January 2016,5.0,62,Traveled with friends,-1,4.0,-1,5.0,4.0,-1

Third, the place is very conveniently located. The mall next to it has a varieties of restaurants depending on what you want to eat and how much you want to pay for.  The tube and the light rail is right there.  You can get into the center of London in about 15 minutes.  Last but no least, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  We contacted them before arriving into London for transportation and it was there at the time we agreed upon. The fee was pre-negotiated so there is no surprises.  It was pretty easy for to arrange for transport back to the airport also.  And if you want to be cheap, you can ride the tube.

The hotel is excellent as are the staff, the views and the facilities all around.  The hotel is right in the center of the Westfield shopping centre so access to shops, bars, restaurants, and travel links are all only a few minutes away.  Rooms on the Olympic park side of the hotel have wonderful views over London although if you like to have your window open the noise from the nearby railway lines can cause a little disturbance at night.  Rooms on the other side of the hotel are equally nice however, the views aren't as good and the noise from the roof mounted Westfield air conditioning plants can be intrusive if you leave your window open.  If you keep your window closed the exterior noise level on both sides of the hotel is negligible.  Staybridge Suites doesn't have a traditional bar but does have a small gym.  You can purchase various food and drink items from reception.  It's in the same building as Holiday Inn, residents in Staybridge are free to use the bar and gym facilities in Holiday Inn.  Each room has its own little kitchen which is well equipped and for those on longer stays is great as you don't feel compelled to eat out every night.  Breakfast is free and offers a good selection of hot and cold items.  Free laundry facilities are also available.  Every week the hotel has 3 management social evenings where free drinks (including alcohol) and nibbles are available.  This is a great opportunity to meet some of the staff socially.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Thatsjustnotcricket,Very nice suites,Stayed here for 8 weeks- comments belowWhat was good:- The rooms are great - we had a 1 bed apartment so the living room was separate from the bedroom. The room was always cleaned to a high standard. There is a kitchenette with dishwasher - Location - next to Westfield so you can easily go out for dinner or grab something from the Food Court and bring it back to eat in your room- The staff - all staff (receptionist/ concierge / breakfast team) polite and friendly. there is a 24/7 staffed reception- There is a large lounge - if you are here for work you can take you laptop into the lounge next to reception and enjoy the view whist working rather than being in your room -Air-con (hot and cold) always worked well - just give it 20mins to get to the right temperature-Quiet - unlike the holiday inn on the 3rd floor the Staybridge Suites has a quieter feel Tips- there is a Apple TV in the room but you need to pay for it. I suggest bringing a HDMI cable and plug your laptop into the back of the TV- if you can afford it try and get a 1-bed apartment rather than normal suite - There are no free weights or running machines in the Staybridge Gym. However you are able to use the Holiday Inn gym on the 3rd floor which has free weights up to 20kg dumbbells and 3 running machines. There is a static bench press up to 93.5KG in each gym. - Order Nandos 20mins in advance online. This means you do not have to wait when collecting from the Food Court- Internet is free but pretty average - don't expect anything above 10mbps - If you want a view ask for one as not all the rooms look out over the Olympic Park,October 2015,5.0,33,Traveled on business,5.0,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,-1

The view we had was unexpected in the sense that I did not think we would have such a nice view of the Olympic area (stadium, the 'Orbit' etc.). I did not know the 'Orbit' lit up at night, that was a nice surprise!It was also good to have our own cooking utensils if we wanted to use them, though we only used the cutlery and microwave. The bathroom was lovely and the shower was very spacious.The breakfast this morning was lovely, as well. The cooked food was hot and there was a lot of food to choose from with a decent selection of teas as well. It's a shame there was no hot chocolate (that I could see), but a wide range of juices made up for that anyway.The service that we experienced was high standard and all staff seemed very friendly. The hotel itself was also very peaceful.The price of the hotel was very reasonable, especially considering the location, and we would not hesitate to visit again. As an added bonus for any shopaholics out there, the hotel is literally on the doorstep of the third largest shopping centre in the UK - now that's convenient!Loved the hotel, loved the stay, and I would recommend to anyone... thank you very much, Staybridge Suites!",October 2015,5.0,25,Traveled as a couple,5.0,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,-1

Having the kitchen area complete with dishwasher, fridge, freezer etc is a real bonus. The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the middle of the Westfield shopping centre, a very large complex that we still have not managed to get all around after two visits. Transport links are second to none anywhere in London, with three tube lines all servicing Stratford, as well as main lines trains and a bus station. We actually took the car on this occasion and the parking in Section B is a very very short walk to the hotel, less than 100m. We saw a show on Saturday afternoon in theatre land, then came back to the hotel and had a lovely meal rather than trying to find a restaurant in theatre land that had any seats available. After that we walked across the mall to the Vue cinema and took in the late night offering of the Legend.

Also 3 nights of the week - the hotel supplied free drinks and nibbles which meant that we could buy something small to supplement it and make it our dinner - a double WOW!There was 24 hour coffee (cappuccinos) and herbal teas;  a whole floor of comfortable couches, tables, chairs, fire place, TV's, books etc to relax and bring friends and family to; a guest laundry; a guest gym; the room had a small kitchen; the hotel was perfectly located 3 minutes away from the train station, 1 minute from the busses and Olympic swimming pool and right in the heart of Westfield shopping complex - so we had everything on our doorstep in terms of food supplies and eating out.

The hotel sits above the shopping centre and Car park B (postcode E20 1EJ), which is closest, has 24hr parking.  This is £9 per day which for London is good value.  Nice and easy access from the car park to the hotel also.We weren't really expecting much as we were just using it as a crash pad for the weekend.  However the rooms are actually fully equipped mini-apartments, which are clean, spacious and have everything you might need for a short stay, including your own kitchenette.  There's also a decent bathroom with good sized shower.Our last stay in London was a poor one, despite selecting a supposed 5 star hotel and despite having membership of that particular chain of hotels.  We are also members of the IHG group, which the Stalybridge Suites is part of and this was a much better experience all round.Staff in particular were more attentive, friendly and helpful and our stay was far more enjoyable and comfortable.I was a little concerned that we might be disturbed by being just above the shopping centre but the insulation must be excellent because we didn't hear anything, despite there being some overnight maintenance being carried out below.It is also very well placed for access with several tube lines, TfL rail and bus station all situated within a few minutes walk.This is definitely one of the better experiences we've had of stays in London and there's no doubt we will be staying here again.",September 2015,5.0,205,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,PR078,Stayed for over a year. The helpful team makes all the difference to this modern hotel,"Excellent hotel, with a warm and helpful team!!I spent a better part of the last 12 months, at this property. I stayed in over 5 different rooms over the period. Overall the rooms were modern, and the interiors were quite new. The bed and the sofa were always clean and comfortable. The upholstery and the furniture looks new, fresh and I have never found anything frayed or worn out during my stay. The kitchenette, though small, is quite utilitarian since you can cook a complete meal and has the essential utensils, a microwave (that doubles up as an oven), a stove with a chimney, a toaster and a kettle. The bathroom fittings are also quite modern and are at a decent standard. I have had colleagues complaining of lack of water pressure at other hotels, however over the course of one year I haven't had a chance to complain about such a thing, nor about the lack of warm water in the shower (one of my pet peeve from an earlier stay in another country). The building is just outside the Westfield Stratford City mall, and has great views of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park, the Arcelor Mittal Orbit and the city skyline from one side of the hotel. Proximity to the shopping mall and the tube station is a big plus if you are travelling on business or leisure, since it gives you quick access to some good hotels and transport. The city view rooms definitely are much quieter. The rooms that open onto the shopping mall side could be tad noisy over Friday and Sat nights.Secondly, the team ensured that my stay was excellent. Special shout out to Nicolas, Anca, Bindi for their wonderful hospitality. The hotel team took care of all the big and little things, and made sure that my stay was comfortable throughout. On a couple of occasions the team went out of their way to get my queries resolved with the Rewards team, and that meant I had to deal with one less thing. The reception staff is always smiling and very keen to help you. I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel, and definitely look forward to visiting it again.",August 2015,5.0,5,Traveled on business,-1,5.0,5.0,5.0,-1,-1

The staff were friendly and helpful.  The concierge, Graham, was very knowledgeable about the city and was always ready to answer any questions we had.  The front desk staff were very pleasant and always greeted us with a smile.  The room was spacious and included a fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, bedroom with a king size bed, and a pull out sofa sleeper in the living room/kitchen area,  with two flat-screen TVs.  AC worked well, and the shower was awesome.  The hotel is located on the northeast side of central London, adjacent to the Olympic Park.  There's a beautiful view from the lobby on the 12th floor (reception desk/breakfast and sitting area is located there) with an outside balcony.  The hotel is located in Westfield Stratford City, one of the largest shopping centers in Europe with 360 stores. The nearest tube station, Stratford, is adjacent to the shopping center and about a 200 meter walk from the hotel door.   Breakfast is included each day and there is a good variety of foods to choose from.  If you want to cook in your room, there's a Waitrose (supermarket chain) in the shopping center about a two minute walk away.  During the week, a manager's social is held on several nights with free wine and cheese, finger foods etc. in the lobby.  The hotel is clean and well-maintained.  The only drawback to the location is that it's about an hour from Heathrow which is on the southeast side of London.  Other popular locations in London averaged about 20-30 minutes via the London Underground (tube), so even though it's not in downtown, it's not hard to get around.

We did use one of the many restaurants in the Westfield, we didn't stay here to do any shopping but it has obvious appeal if that is the purpose of your stay.Good points:+ Lots of onsite parking at a reasonable overnight price+ Good public transport connections from the two adjoining Stratford stations (to Eurostar, overground and underground trains)+ Even numbered rooms have great views of the Olympic Park and taller London landmarks (Shard, Natwest Tower) in the distance+ Usual Staybridge benefits of suites with small kitchens and seating areas+ Excellent service and a very friendly welcomeNot so good points:- Getting to Westfield and the right part of the car park proved more difficult than expected, as my satnav did not recognise the Westfield postcode and there were no signs to Westfield from the older parts of Stratford. Once we had found Westfield, it was easy to find Car Park B as the three Car Parks are well signed, but level P2 isn't obvious once you are in the car park. We had similar problems choosing which car park exit to take when leaving so ended up doing an unnecessary loop of the area to reach our next destination- No lock on the toilet doors in the suites, which is an odd omission and detracts from privacy for guests",August 2015,4.0,780,Traveled as a couple,-1,4.0,-1,5.0,4.0,-1

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,MidlandsTravelg,Good location for Wesfield and easy access to tube to Central London,"Centrally located in the Westfield Shopping Centre, the Staybridge Suites are located in the upper floors of the Holiday Inn.If arriving by car, park in Car Park B Level 2 & follow the signs for the Holiday Inn/Staybridge Suites, take the escalator up and exit into the Chestnut Plaza & the entrance to the hotel is immediately behind you by the digital waterfall.Car Parking costs £9 for 24hrs at weekends & £6 for 24hrs during the week.Access to the tube (Jubilee & Central lines) /rail network & DLR at Stratford Station is 5 mins walk through the shopping centre. Taxis are available outside the centre.With the introduction of 24hr tubes in mid-September, linking into central London throughout the night, this hotel gives you the flexibility to have a late night out in central London coupled with the convenience of driving to the capital, and utilising the cheaper parking in Westfield, than paying the very high parking charges of more centrally located London hotels. There is a concierge 24/7, the reception to the Suites is in the 12 floor. Check in was speedy, efficient and the girls on reception very friendlyThis floor overlooks the Olympic Park and is also the location for the buffet breakfast, which is served up to 10.30am at weekends.There is a choice of cereals, juices, fresh fruit, yogurt, fruit compote, breads & pastries, cheese, tea & coffee and a selection of hot food comprising scrambled egg, bacon, sausages, beans & hash browns, the buffet was frequently refreshed and the quality is pretty good.You can take breakfast back to your suite if so desired.There is also a small outside patio area which has great views of the park & the London skyline.Adjacent to reception there is also a ""pantry"" where you can buy chilled ready-made meals and various other items if you cater in your suite, however M&S is very close by if you want a larger selection of food.The studio suites are quiet, modern, clean and tastefully furnished, with a kitchenette containing, hob, microwave/grill, toaster, kettle, fridge, dishwasher, tea & coffee. An iron & ironing board is also provided. There is a reasonable amount of storage space and a safe is built into the wardrobe.There is an easy chair & work station area, and a sort of breakfast bar arrangement with a chair suitable for one person to eat at but no table and chairs so not that easy if two guests are wanting to eat in the suite. The king-size bed was comfortable, with nice linen.The shower room is compact but adequate with a double sized shower, good quality towels & toiletries.Your door key is needed to access the lift to suite levels, so security is good.There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel.This comfortable hotel provides excellent value for money, it is in a good location for Westfield, Canary Wharf , the O2 and the attractions of the East End of London, yet also offers a convenient link into central London.",June 2015,4.0,234,Traveled as a couple,4.0,-1,4.0,4.0,-1,-1

I've been to London many times, first time with my kid, and this hotel is by far the most modern I've seen.

The central line will get you to Oxford circus or change at Holborn to the Piccadilly line which connect to all the thrust location. The room are quit new and are better than what you usually get in London.The breakfast is very poor. But there are many options for breakfast very close by. The Apple TV does not work. I asked and was answer they stop the contract with the company that support it. The internet is crappy. And although it's listed it just don't work. The room I booked on booking is an upgrade room. And although I paid a higher price for it. The reception guy told me that room are dependent on availability and that they can't promise I'll get the room I payed for. Lucky for me I didn't have to argue cause they just had 1 suite left. The bed was suppose to be a king size but again they said they can't promise that and the bed was not a king and not even queen.

From start to finish the whole experience was fantastic - it couldn't have been better. Before my stay I emailed to ask if staff could decorate our room on our first evening whilst we went out. I received a very quick and lovely response saying this was not a problem. On arrival we checked into our room, which was wonderful! We had a view looking over the Olympic park (which I had requested, but wasn't guaranteed to get) and the staff had even left a bottle of wine in our room to help my partner celebrate his Birthday. As promised, they had also decorated our room whilst we had our first evening out, with banners and bunting I had given them. The room was very spacious, clean, tidy, and the floor we were staying on was very quiet - we had a wonderful night's sleep. Breakfast in the morning was great, loads of choice, with views looking across the Olympic Park. They even have a balcony, which I guess had the weather been warmer we could have sat outside for breakfast. The hotel also has gym facilities available, although we didn't have time to utilize these.Although the hotel is a little way out from Central London, we had no problems getting into the centre on the underground/DLR. There are plenty of shops/restaurants on the doorstep which is fantastic, and plenty to do within the Westfield centre. I much preferred being slightly out of the centre, and am so glad I chose to stay here.All in all this was a fantastic stay, we loved the hotel, it's location, and it's facilities, and would not hesitate to book another stay here next time I visit London.I would like to thank all the wonderful staff for their help in making our weekend special, and one to remember.",April 2015,5.0,146,Traveled as a couple,-1,5.0,-1,5.0,-1,5.0

Get a room looking towards the stadium though because the Casino opposite in Westfield is noisy at the weekend and you can hear it even with the window shut.The breakfast room is good but not sure about the cleanliness aspect of people sharing the same cereal boxes & milk cartons.

These suites are IDEALLY located withIN one of the most amazing malls London has to offer!! What could be more ideal than shopping till your feet hurt, eat just about ANYTHING your heart desires then just simply going up to your very comfortable suite and relax?! Nothing! Also, you are a tube ride away from any other hotspot you would want to visit. But fantastic location aside, the staff and service is so warm and polite, yummy buffet breakfast included. I stayed on the 10th floor. The room was clean! Has a nice posh feel to it for a reasonable price, kitchenette included and nice views- bed comfy and you have the ability to control your room temperature :) It is also very secure- rooms only accessible from the lift with your room card. We were out all of yesterday (of course) and when we returned, we found our room cleaned, bed made, there were important/valued items/cash laying around which were all untouched. Very impressive Additionally, there was a complimentary drink/cocktail hour each night of our stay but we missed it because we got caught up shopping so I cannot comment on that perk/feature but I'm sure it was pretty awesome :)The only ""con"" I experienced is that after 10/11pm weeknights - food find was challenging. There is a 24 hr confectionery area at reception but nothing of real substance for the hungry person. There is room service - prices a little steep and only limited items are available beyond 11pm.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone willing to listen!Loved it and will definitely return!",April 2015,5.0,373,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Mel_Jites,Awesome stay in a great affordable hotel! IN LONDON!,"Good London hotels and affordable pricing tend not to go together. Just like London hotels and large rooms are also opposites. But this is not the case at Staybridge Suites. Sure with the GBP being what it is, it's not exactly cheap but compared to its competitors, for what you get this is a bargain!Conveniently located to the Westfield mall (by which I mean, this is pretty much IN the mall), there is every kind of shopping and dining experience imaginable. To save some coins, the rooms also come equipped with a kitchenette (with stove top and microwave) and dinnerware, so you can comfortably eat in. This hotel is in Zone 3 if you're considering the underground, but on the central line train (located just steps from this hotel), you can be in central London in less than 20 minutes so it's pretty convenient. Most of my business was in central London and West London (where my friends were) so I was pretty much on the opposite side of town from them but the transport links were excellent and as a single woman travelling alone, I never felt unsafe coming back into the hotel late at night even when the mall was closed.I stayed in 2 different types of rooms over the course of my 1 week stay. A few days in a standard studio and and my last few days in a 1 bedroom king because my friend was coming to stay with me in the hotel and I thought I would need the room. With hindsight, this was probably unnecessary. The Studio Suite is plenty big enough for 2 adults. You could probably even throw in a child (maybe not 2 unless the 2nd one is a really small child) and be perfectly alright. The difference between the Studio and the 1 bedroom is minimal in terms of space. The bedroom area of the 1 bedroom king is pretty small and the living room feels a little narrow (more or less the size of the typical London front room) so whilst the room is patently bigger than the studio suite, you lose the feeling of space the open plan studio gives you. It IS nice to have 2 rooms though and if you're staying a little longer or with someone with a different sleep schedule or different entertainment tastes, it's nice to have the option of two rooms and two tvs. The sofa in my 1-bedroom suite was very comfortable and I suppose one could sleep on it, but it was not a pull-out sofa with a bed or anything. The bathrooms were lovely and I really liked the full-size toiletries.The hotel offers a nice, homey, simple breakfast that I'd describe as continental with extras (eggs, youghurt, some days baked beans or tomatoes, some days grilled mushrooms, some days bacon or sausage). Everything is tasty and feels fresh and not mass produced even though this isn't a particularly small hotel. I don't think any other meals are offered at the hotel, although I think there was a happy hour I didn't attend. At the reception, there's a little grocery that sells snacks and frozen meals you can whip up in your room at a pinch if for some reason you couldn't get your shopping done. There is a room service menu available in the rooms and room service runs pretty late (maybe even 24h?) so that option is also there. Wi-fi is freely available for unlimited devices and it's pretty good for free hotel wifi.If you're trying to save money and/or you're concerned about your waistline and want to eat healthy, you're not limited to Waitrose and M&S Food in Westfield or the dining options in the mall. There's a smaller, less fancy mall on the other side of the train station called Stratford Center and they have a farmer's market type situation right the middle of the mall with fresh produce of different kinds. There's a butcher shop (the proper kind where they attend to you) and a Sainsbury's supermarket much cheaper than the Westfield offerings. Basically, food is not a problem.The staff is incredibly friendly and professional, very helpful and a real credit to the hotel. There is a lot of seating between the lobby (on the top floor) and the breakfast room with a spectacular view and newspapers and magazines so it's a lovely place to hang out as well pre or post breakfast or if you need to checkout early. I sat there only once because I arrived really early before my room was ready (and was also allowed to have breakfast even though I wasn't entitled to it). Overall, I had a lovely stay and it's definitely one of my go tos, if it's available when I'm in London.",March 2015,4.0,61,Traveled with friends,-1,4.0,4.0,5.0,-1,-1

Check-in was quick and the young man on the desk could not have been more polite and attentive. The room was spacious with a small kitchen area, which was very useful. We bought some food from the Waitrose at the Westfield centre, instead of dining out, which was a nice change. My only issue here was the lack of cutlery. We may have caught them on a poor day, but I think someone should perhaps have an inventory check.They had a manager's reception on the night we stayed, which provided wine and beer, with snacks/salad. It was really well done, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming.The air conditioning in the room worked well, and the window could also be opened, which I like. The bed was pretty comfortable, too. Basic Wifi is free, but my husband and I paid the £7 premium fee which allowed us to access our own stuff on the Apple TV that was provided in the room.

Absolutely brilliant. Staff were always friendly and talked - they got to know me in the 10 months. Room was always cleaned spotlessly every morning whilst at work. The rooms were a good size with the kitchen area separate from the bedroom. Sofa bed in living room, and if i ever had a friend staying, staff always responded promptly to me asking for extra duvets etc, this was never a problem. If I ever had any problems, blown bulbs etc, management always responded and sorted the issue really quickly. Location wise it was great, right beside Westfield so good for shopping. Could rant on for days about the level of care and attention I received but couldnt possibly mention everything, so will just leave it here.

It was refreshing to find the rooms looked identical to the pictures on the website.  Decor tasteful, clean and modern and there was room to move around the bed!  The shower was lovely - perfect if like us, you like to shower together!  The area is great and the view is amazing although nothing can beat how it must have looked during the Olympics - ah, what a wonderful Summer that was!  The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is the breakfast experience.  Whilst the food choice was extensive and the staff were friendly, everything kept running out in minutes, even the forks!  This resulted in guests constantly having to ask staff to replenish items but not enough was brought out or the dishes were too small so everyone who was already waiting emptied supplies again within seconds.  I completely understand that if more food is put out, more will be taken and lets face it, most people are greedy in these circumstances but the situation could be made better by a bigger hot food area and larger containers for the eggs, sausages and bacon and larger containers for the knives and forks.  Hot chocolate would be nice too but that's only a really minor item and only because I don't drink tea or coffee!

Nicely decorated but most impressively spotlessly clean.We had a studio on the 9th floor with a king size bed, well appointed bathroom with a very large shower and a kitchen that lacked for nothing. Again beautifully designed and very clean throughout.We also got a free self service hot buffet breakfast which was excellent.The front of house staff had a smile and were extremely helpful.

We asked questions, asked if it was possible to have 1 room later so we could return to shower following the run - nothing was too much trouble. AND he gave us free cookies!

Or why not take a stroll around the Olympic Park - it's right across the road.The rooms were lovely - HUGE bed, HUGE shower, kitchen facilities - I couldn't fault a thing.

My wife and I stayed in a one bedroom suite No 1110 on the 11th floor overlooking the Olympic Park. I must say the suite was perfect for our 15night stay. Separate bedroom, lounge and kitchen also a spacious bathroom. Lots of shops and eating places right outside in the shopping centre. The A/C took a bit of working out we did not seem able to set it where we wanted. All the train services and buses also on the doorstep. Breakfast was O/K but is crying out for an egg station. Scrambled eggs end up like rubber. Staff very polite and helpful. The social drink and nibbles during the week was very pleasant. A down side was the bad behaviour of several children. Hands in the food is very off putting. At each night and early morning there was lots of thumping noise coming from above our room which I know for a fact was caused by children running around in the lounge area on the 12th floor. I actually went up there one evening and two children were playing with a ball up there. It is a shame that parents allow their children to behave this way  and I believe this establishment would benefit from making it adults only. It is a bit hard to see why families would want to stay there as there is no facilities for children. We would stay there again but in a room not affected by the noise from the 12th floor.

Sad to say in October this year their standards have dropped. Rooms, location and sleep comfort are all still very good but they have dropped the ball for service.Check in time is 3:00pm. We arrived at 3:10pm and our room was still not ready till 3:30. Check was very clinical with no smiles or ""welcome to Staybridge"". In both rooms of our suite the windows looked like they had not been cleaned properly, or at all, for quite some time. When the box of tissues in the bathroom runs out, instead of replacing  with a new one, they just stuff a handful of tissues into the empty box.Check out was even more clinical than check in. All that was said to me was ""you have prepaid so there is nothing more to pay"". There was no ""have a nice day or hope you enjoyed stay"". NOTHING. As a IHG Rewards Club Gold Elite member I found the check in/out attitudes very disappointing.

IHG did this a while ago for hotels inside the M25 to make the appear cheaper, judging by my conversation with the desk staff, i am not the only one to have complained about this.

Because of the people who make this hotel what it is. Starting with a warm and efficient check in, a nice elegant clean room, equipped with a full kitchen, You get up to a good breakfast, (the special artisan breads and cherry tomatoes were a nice addition to the regular rich selection), and come back to their social evenings (3 times a week) with wine/beer, good cheese, and welcoming staff members.  Unfortunately, our daughter got sick and being in a foreign country, the information and guidance we received from the caring staff in the reception, was invaluable.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,musap2013,"Very poor service, unwelcoming, at a premium price!","Now, I'll try and keep it concise.My wife and I arrived at the hotel to be seen by Bindi. Checked in easily. We arrived at Room 1101, which was not cleaned properly. There were red stains on the carpet and dust on the surfaces. In addition, the room was quite small and also had a broken shelf. We reported this to reception, who arranged for housekeeping to fix. Two hours later, we returned to the room and nothing had changed. So we visited reception again, and spoke to Sarah. Now Sarah had the most disgusting attitude from any hotel staff member I have ever experienced. Her response to our complaint was, ""What do you want me to do about it?"" Is it not that I'm the guest and Staybridge is the host, and Sarah should be answering the question rather than asking it? Her attitude was horridly disgusting, at which point I considered cancelling my reservation. I rang hotels.com, through whom I made my booking, and discussed cancelling my booking with a very pleasant gentleman. Naturally, they wanted to keep the business and discussed options with Sarah and myself, and agreed to offer me an upgrade to a one bedroom suite instead of studio. At such short notice to find another room, we took the offer up. This room was admittedly much cleaner and larger. Overall, the service was abysmal. Looking beyond that, as difficult as it is, it's pretty much mixed opinions. The wifi was good, as was the room we finally ended up in. Breakfast was more than adequate, allowing a self-service takeaway option as well which was useful. However, breakfast ends at 9:30 on weekdays - too early! Manager's Reception on weeknights was a nice touch. The gym had the basics (no free weights), and there was a launderette available too. Parking was low-priced for London standards and plentiful. But the hotel is found wanting with respect to the 'little things' as some might say. For instance, the lift had a broken support handle. The iron in the room did not iron particularly well. There are no vanity sets - this might seem ridiculous to some, but at around £150 per night, I want these things! Some of the furniture had original product stickers on them from wherever they were purchased (Room 916). And the hotel corridors and foyers and lifts (aside from reception and breakfast area) seem to have a stale smell about them which could easily be fixed by some air freshener or fragrant diffuser. The toilet in the room has the flush hidden behind the seat lid, so you have to put the seat lid down when you flush - not major, just annoying. You have to switch on the in-room phone to actually use it, even though the lights on the phone suggest that it's ready to use. This is not obvious and not mentioned at check in. Finally, housekeeping could easily be improved. Replacing the towels and opening the windows is not good enough. I expect a little tidy up too eg crisp wrappers and empty drink bottles to be cleared, and this was not done in any of my SIX nights of stay. Regarding the staff, I dealt with Sarah who I have mentioned already. By contrast, the other staff were reasonably pleasant (Bindi, Lauren,Helen and Joao) and I met one suited gentleman on a Tuesday afternoon whose name I didn't catch who was exceptionally polite and courteous, and someone that all the staff should learn from. Would I stay here again? No. Given the service I received from Sarah, definitely not. I have stayed in Holiday Inn just underneath it (owned by the same overall company) and they were fine last year, as was Premier Inn Stratford (again, nearby), so I would reconsider returning to these guys if I must stay in Stratford. They don't promise any luxuries, but at least they deliver the basics well without disappointment or shoddy service.",September 2014,2.0,17,not mentioned,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Unfortunately their facility can only provide a version of scrambled eggs and hard boiled (cold) eggs for breakfast. Would have liked poached eggs, but the staff were mostly able to provide us fresh eggs, which we poached in our room.Being located next door to Westfield with 400 shops, dozens of quality restaurants and direct central line access is also great.The only difficulty is the parking is in the Westfield car park, with a daily max rate of 5 pound weekdays and 8 pound weekends, but makes no allowance for a visitor that is coming and going from the car park a few times a day, incurring the minimum 2.50 pound charge each time.

Breakfasts were fine, although the layout takes some getting used to.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable - on my previous visit I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite, but this time it was a standard room, which still had a good amount of space.  As the hotel is on the top few floors of the building all of the rooms have good views, but those on the same side as the reception have the best views.

We arrived at Heathrow, and took the London Underground (tube) to this hotel, the trip itself took about an hour and ten minutes, but it stops very close to the hotel (two minute walk). We chose this hotel because although it was a ways from the city center, it had rooms with a kitchenette. The check in process was easy, and the front desk staff are very polite, and very helpful. The lobby was clean, with a large sitting area, and there was also an area to purchase snacks, and have a beverage. This hotel also serves breakfast. This hotel looks out on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (complex for some events of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games), and also on Westfield Stratford City Mall. The rooms are immaculate, and the kitchenettes were well stocked with all that one would need for a meal preparation. There is a Marks and Spencer in the mall, with a grocery store in the basement, and although it is not a full size grocery store, they carry almost everything you could want for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. The rooms are also equipped with a hair dryer, iron and ironing board, and wifi is available. There is also a laundry room for guests to use, but the washers and dryers do take longer than what we are used to in the US.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,zoobwa1,Nice hotel...some of the staff need to be let go...,"Stayed at this property last month during a week-long trip to London.   Here is my feedback:Pros:The hotel is newer and connected to a shopping mall which is convenient.  The Jubilee and Central lines (underground train) end here, but watch out for periodic strikes so have plan B's ready for transport.The views of Olympic Park are great!The operations manager, Nicholas, should be immediately promoted as he has awesome cust service skills.   He was very pro-active and understands the needs of clients and customers.  The canteen is stocked 24 hours with snacks, drinks, and ice cream :)The housekeeping staff do not speak English, but they are AWESOME!   The staff are courteous and do a wonderful job cleaning.The shower head was amazingly refreshing - the massage functionality alone makes it one of the top shower heads in the hospitality business.  Cons:The greeting was terrible...we arrived at 11am from the U.S. and the young blonde at the front desk reception yells, ""You can't check in until 3pm"".   Wow...what a warm welcome.    She needs some serious customer service training.   Especially, after staying at another IHG property last time (Intercontinental Park Lane) in 2012, having such a lukewarm and rude awakening..we were about to bail but the operations manager, Nicholas was a great listener, and promised to take good care of us...he was excellent!The breakfast needs to improve and the breakfast staff are not warm - they're so into turning around the tables that they feel offended if we ask them any questions.   Suggestion:  they need to relax or get them more resources to be able to get to know the hungry breakfast comers.   One of the nice gestures the hotel has is to allow customers to take a breakfast tray to their rooms.  However, the trays are found in the room.   They should have a smaller tray or replacement trays avail in the dining area.   I came all the way down desiring to take a tray back to the room, but was told to go back to my room to get the tray....whew!The bath tub is too high off the ground...for a guy who is 6', i nearly slipped on the way out...maybe add a step for the tub.   Overall, great hotel but mediocre service from a couple of bad apples.   Most of the staff are awesome and look exhausted and overworked.   The GM of the hotel was in the office a couple of times that week but does not communicate with any guests.    The higher management should smile a bit more and say 'hi' to clients, especially when their meetings are in the dining area.  It seems the Staybridge Suites we've stayed at in the U.S. are a bit more warmer than this particular one in the U.K. and it clearly shows.   As a Platinum Elite IHG member, would think twice about staying here here again...only if they address some of the opportunities for improvement mentioned in this review.",August 2014,3.0,34,Traveled with family,-1,3.0,-1,2.0,-1,5.0

I chose this hotel for many reasons: one was accessibility both by bus, overground, underground and mainline station. Arriving from Liverpool Street Station it is direct to Stratford on the Central line or arriving from Waterloo or London Bridge Stations it is direct on the Jubilee line. The complex surrounding the hotel has bars, restaurants, shops, supermarkets and cinemas; my main consideration was the kitchen, we were tired of eating out the two weeks previously and with the shopping centre food was a doddle. Breakfast was included and it is the same as most hotels we stayed in, the view is excellent from the 12th floor overlooking the Olympic park. On this floor there is a very nice lounge with plenty of seating space. Our room on the 8th floor had a very good view. The suite was well equipped with fridge, microwave and dishwasher.  The shower was very good (like a waterfall according to the ten-year old) but we found it odd that the bathroom light was permanently on all night unless we removed the door key card from the slot. Not an exceptional choice of tv programmes for the 10-year old, I had to suffer Viva but we were there when the Commonwealth games were on in Glasgow so we followed some of that on BBC. All in all I was very satisfied with my stay and both the reception staff and breakfast staff are very nice people.",July 2014,5.0,2,Traveled with family,-1,5.0,5.0,5.0,-1,-1

Using the underground (subway) we were able to be in the middle of London in about 20 mins depending on which underground line we used.

We had a deluxe studio suite on the 11th floor which had an amazing view. The suite had a small kitchen with a microwave, fridge, dishwasher, and all the necessary items to prepare meals. Breakfast was included each morning and made for an easy start to the day. The hotel also had a laundry on the 12th floor with 4 washers and dryers available at no charge. The room was serviced each week day, and weekend service was available if requested (no additional charge).The staff were extremely helpful and the concierge was full of helpful information, Bathroom was a little on the small side and the only negative thing was there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom, apart from the shaver outlet, also only one hook to hang up towels, but this was only a minor inconvenience.

Also all china and cutlery in the kitchen.Lovely bedrooms with a huge  comfortable bed. Apple TV is also available on the tv menu. Great bathroom. Our bath room had a 1200mm walk in shower with power shower but no bath. Very well planned with everything you'd need thought of. The air conditioning was very quiet. Parking is very close and cost £13.20 for the weekend. Then just a couple of minutes walk brings you to the hotel. You are immediately in the shopping precinct amid the great choice of restaurants and bars.the hotel staff are really good and genuinely appear helpful. If the shops are closed   You can purchase snack items to cook in your room from the reception which is on the 12th floor, ie a choice of ready meals, canned soups, etc so you'll never go hungry. Stratford station is a short 5-10 minutes walk at the most. The station makes any part of London easily reached. You can get an Oyster travel card from the machines there and pay as you go on all London Transport including buses. The hotel is by far the best situated in Westfield. Breakfast is a buffet but not a full English as most hotels are, however the choice is sufficient enough to please everybody, try to avoid the late breakfast  times as the hot dishes aren't replaced quickly enough to serve everyone at once.

I would like to specially mention Debbie (Restaurant/kitchen), Nicholas (Ops Manager), Tim (Ops) have been exceptional. Of course other staff are equally friendly and cheerful.Location is brilliant, stone's throw away from Stratford Olympics center, Tube Station, Bus Station.

The Front desk staff were excellent and very polite and helpful at all times especially Tim and a young lady who was expecting (sorry forgot you're name).The rooms were furnished to a high standard with everything you needed if you choose to stay in at night to cook a meal in the kitchen,the settee in the living room was quite hard in some places but as strange as this sounds the more you laid/sat on it became quite comfortable, the bed was very nice too the mattress being hard but this is what type of mattress we have at home, so we had a excellent sleep.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,MeAndMrsJonesUK,"Fabulous, Simply Fabulous!","Perfectly located in the Stratford Westfield shopping complex this hotel, with apartment style rooms, has a warm welcome and friendly staff who attend to all your needs from the moment you arrive. Having been in contact directly with the hotel team our earlier than normal check in was accommodated with no fuss and the check in and reception team were excellent. I have stayed in many hotels, specifically in London, but none compare to the feel and experience I had at the Staybridge. Our room was located on the same floor as reception which made things easier, for breakfast and the social evenings. We had a studio room which was big enough for us both with a kitchen arrangement as you enter the room, very large king size bed, (may even have been super king?) along with a desk to work at, easy chair and space to relax. The kitchen has all the pots pans and cutlery you need to cook your own evening meals if you wish, halogen hob, microwave/oven, fridge/freezer and dishwasher. Daily housekeeping even attend to your dirty dishes, loading them in the dishwasher so you don't have to!The bathroom is plenty big enough and features a double size shower. Amenities are provided and the whole place had a good clean feel to it. Breakfast has ample offerings of cereal, pastries and got dishes which are changed daily to provide some variation. Fruit juice, tea, coffee, water and soft drinks are also available. This is an excellent breakfast choice, not a mass produced buffet style experience that some other hotels provide. In the reception area is a very large lounge area that has TVs dotted about should you wish to sit and relax. The balcony provides an outside sitting area overlooking the Olympic stadium and park area, the view of the city skyline through canary wharf to the O2 is fabulous. Tea, coffee, soft drinks and sometimes pastries are available at all times in the lounge area and I liken this to a typical 'executive lounge' offering in hotels that you pay to be upgraded to experience, this is all part of the service at this Staybridge!What is also worth mentioning, and also compounds the executive lounge comparison, is that on Tues, Weds and Thurs evenings there are the managers social events whereby complimentary snacks, nibbles, hot offerings and alcohol are offered as part of the hotels drive to get people to meet their staff and each other. This works really well and I have to say was the cherry on too of the icing in the cake!A laundry room and gym is located on the 12th floor, as is reception, and you can utilise the Holiday Inn's places to eat and room service during your stay also. This is not your typical hotel and experience. The staff are genuinely interested, not typical patronising 'how are you' questions. The management appear to have worked out what a hotel visitor wants from a stay and deliver it to perfection. The suites are spacious, clean, perfectly located and provide a great experience that you can't quite put your finger on but you just get a good feeling about the whole stay. The suites offer a long stay option as well as the causal visitor/tourist few nights requirement and I am so impressed I have already made arrangements to stay for 3 months at the end of the year!Well done to all the team and I look forward to returning in September!",May 2014,5.0,361,Traveled on business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The service from the moment you walk through the door is excellent.  We stayed in a one bedroom suite, which was fine for our two night stay but I don't think it was well enough equipped for longer stays.  The room was a decent size and was comfortable enough for us.  The hotel is conveniently located next to Westfield Stratford and all of its amenities, while it is only about 20 minutes into Central London it is a bit further out than I would normally like to be, this is the only reason that we probably would not stay here again.

So what happened?Well, our stay exceeded all expectations; this is a great place to stay and no review could do it justice.First, the location is great for shopping in the Westfield shopping centre, you’re right in the centre itself. The entrance to the building can be difficult to spot if you are unfamiliar with the centre but the helpful concierge staff soon had us in front of the reception on the 12th floor. The reception staff are very friendly and helpful; explaining everything we needed to know about our stay.Our suite, a king size bedroom and separate living area, was spacious and well furnished, very clean and well laid out. The room had an Apple TV attached to the large LCD TV in the living room and there was another TV in the bedroom. The bathroom was large and well laid out. This was a great place to chillout and relax. I had the best night’s sleep I have ever had in any hotel; the bed was so comfy. We stayed over the weekend so the shopping centre was busy, even late at night, but the noise level was very quiet. The Internet connection in the room was good; we did pay the extra for the faster connection and access to our Netflix and Apple Match movies via the Apple TV; this is a great add-on service.We used the on-site pantry for soft-drinks; all items added to our account without any fuss by the helpful staff and reasonably priced. The breakfast was a surprise; all food options are covered, hot, cold, healthy and just plain indulgent! Add to this a great view over the Olympic park and a sunny day and you have the recipe for a great start to the day.The underground station is a 5 minute walk from the suites. Central London is 30 minutes away on the underground and the Excel Centre is 15 minutes on the DLR.The suite prices reflect the quality of the suites; I considered them reasonable for a London hotel. Check-in and -out was fast and efficient, our account was accurate.I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It is a credit to Stratford and London.

The bed was very comfortable and I slept perfectly.  The only thing I would have liked is a softer pillow (only due to neck problem) but apart from that we thought it was perfect!  The breakfast was plenty.  Though id suggest to go down earlier whilst its nice and fresh as the bacon was solid by time we went to have breakfast but as I said we did get down there late!  Brilliant car parking in Westfield shopping centre, car park B for us, right by the hotel, and to go shopping in Westfield we just stepped out of the hotel and we were there.

The proximity of the shopping center and the array of restaurants around make it for an excellent stay. The staff is very nice, friendly and helpful. They are the ideal representation and image of the diverse cultural backgrounds which make East London so vibrant and attractive. And I believe that it contributes to create a genuine, caring atmosphere at the hotel. The rooms / suite are great, well appointed. When you think of how much you pay, it looks classy, stylish and really on par with some far more expensive properties in downtown. Breakfast is a good experience not to be missed, quality and quantity have found the right balance. Overall, I could not recommend this place enough and I shall return as soon as I am given the opportunity. Yes, it is a bit far way from the West End but with the javelin train bringing you to St Pancreas in 5 minutes, you cannot really complain !",February 2014,4.0,34,Traveled on business,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Sitting there in the morning ,eating breakfast ,it was spectacular. Staff were helpful as usual.  Loved the opportunity to help ourselves at any time for a coffee in the Pantry and sit , watching the view, relaxing. Took 30 minutes to get from the suite to west end to see a show.

The hotel is very homely with friendly staff and an atmosphere which conjures up random conversations between guests unlike any hotel I've stayed at before. Easy early check in to a room with a stunning Olympic park view as preferenced. One bedroom suite was spacious, clean and worth the upgrade. Also has the added benefit of a sofa bed and a bath. Breakfast was of a good standard and also made use of The Den to do some work, which is a nicely furnished communal living room/library. I cannot fault this hotel.

I arrived at the reception desk and was greated by Tim with the fantastic American Accent. He was very professional explaining everything to me re breakfast times etc. I went to my room and it was lovely a proper little apartment. A lovely compact kitchen area with everything you could possibly want, kettle, toaster, dish washer, hob for cooking etc. The lounge had an really comfortable sofa with a plasma screen with apple tv to use if you have an account. There was also another plasma in the bedroom. The bathroom had full size toiletries including shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. I had lunch in the Holiday inn that day, which was a very good sized chicken burger with chips. It was quick to turn up and very generous portion of chips. I then had afternoon tea in there after doing some shopping in Westfield which was fantastic proper tea leaves with a twinings timer which I had to wait 3 1/2 mintutes for it to brew. It was lovely to sit there and look out over the olympic park. I went out to dinner that evening with a friend in westfield. We then went to 'The Den' which is back int he Staybridge Suites to watch some TV. It was really nice to sit there and have free tea while sitting there chilling. When I went to bed it didnt take me long to drift off as the bed was so comfortable I forgot that I was actually staying in a hotel. The following morning I woke up and had the most amazing shower, the shower head is huge, I thought from previous hotel stays that the pressure for the shower was going to be rubbish. Oh no I was totally mistaken, the water came flying out as each of the rooms has its own set of pipes. I really didnt want to get out of the shower. I actually went to look at the breakfast in the Staybridge which looked lovely but ended up eating with my friend in the Holiday Inn below which was lovely. A very good selection of breakfast items and they also managed to get me some gluten free bread for toasting which was a very  nice touch.

Very comfortable room with Microwave/convention oven dishwasher, sink and utensils to cook around a basic meal. Fridge for your wine. Spacious airy and bright room. Bathroom is limited to a shower which was disappointing. Comfy bed, towels average quality and basic toiletries provided. Breakfast buffet was good and the area has a home from home kitchen feel, where you can mull over a recipe book, which are provided in the area. Tea and coffee available if you require during the day. No housekeeping service provided, however, if you wish they will organise for you. I consider this a pre requisite but I can understand that this is a nod to guests who don't wish to be disturbed and staybridge cleverly market it this way. Great free laundry facilities should you require and good gym over looking the stadium. The staff were amazing, courteous, polite, helpful and very friendly. On the doorstep of an amazing shopping and leisure centre with excellent transport links. A really comfortable enjoyable stay.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,JS3PO,"Good, but not worthy of top rating","London rooms can be problematic, they are small, expensive, sometimes old and run-down, so at least this was in decent shape being new and provided a comfortable sleep, but this isn't worth a 5-star review...which should be reserved for the exceptional and special places that go beyond basic function.On the positive side, the location is good if you need to be on this end of the city for a conference at the Excel Center. It is handy to have shopping and dining options of the Westfield mall down the elevator.  They have a nice breakfast buffet and good shower temperature and pressure with rain shower head.  I can see the small kitchenette being useful for longer stays.  The price was good compared to options in central London.Things that could be better include rooms that are small and nothing special; no comfortable area to sit in the room, hence the large public areas near the breakfast room. My room showed signs of wear with broken tiles, chipped furniture, stains on floor/wall.  A pet peeve is that the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel are in open large bottles and not sealed or fresh per check-in.  I don't like this and decided to buy my own from the drugstore in the mall.  Free WiFi is too slow to work effectively; had to pay extra to upgrade to premium speed level.  Location is not near much beyond the mall and the dining options are not really local options, felt like chain restaurants like at a mall back home; if you looking for local flavor look for something more central. Entrance is in the mall so you do have to deal with your luggage through the shopping area even if dropped off by car.To get here from Heathrow I recommend you take the tube if you can mange your luggage down one flight of stairs - it is one connection at Holborn and takes about 1 hour and costs about £6.00 per person vs. a £100.00 cab ride that also can take about an hour.",February 2014,4.0,11,Traveled on business,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

The room we stayed in was in good working order and not signs of any damage.  Overall, we were impressed with what was in the room and the overall layout.Reception (on 12th Floor - take lifts on right as you enter building) was very efficient and Timothy was very helpful, polite and 'quick' with the whole check-in process.The room/corridor noise was minimal and we slept (we have two 6 month old baby daughters) very well.  Breakfast, consisted a buffet of simple cooked and continental food.  I am not a breakfast person (eggs/bacon and double espresso) and my wife is a cereal and toast person - the buffet was more that adequate.We found a number of restaurants very close to suites, though it was extremely busy on a Saturday night – I would recommend to explore in the day, see where youi want to eat and book.  With the huge amount of choices and a Waitrose supermarket then there really is something for everyone in a very close area.I will definitely stay again, when we are back down for another event.

Can't recommend it enough if you want to avoid central London prices, have a decent size room and feel at home. Was let down by quite a few little things; on arrival kettle had 2cm of descaler left in it! Luckily I noticed and didn't make a cuppa, almost did though. Mentioned it to reception as this could have been dangerous, but they just said they would get someone to clean it out (which they never did!)The sofa in our lounge was beyond uncomfortable, the padding must have been very cheap as can only be a year or so old, but it's flat and solid. This made sitting in the lounge a waste of time, and money for the upgrade!Strangely you can upgrade your TV to Apple TV and use airplay, great, we could keep upto date with the soaps on demand. Unfortunately the Apple TV only works on the lounge TV as the bedroom TV is not connected up, and with the sofa being unusable, well another wasted upgrade!The finish to the rooms must have been very quick, paint peeling off all over, shame really as it's a nice looking hotel, but as long as you don't look too hard you don't notice, so didn't worry me too much.Photos and description of the one bedroom suite made out they had baths, but only a shower. Was a big reason to upgrade, so felt a little mis-soldEnough of the negatives (even though that's probably more what your interested in), the positives;Excellent location, 15 mins tube to central london.Very friendly team at the hotel, especially breakfast team who seemed very friendly (which is often rare at breakfast)Friendly reception team, but lacked genuine concern it seemed at times, even though they always asked.Modern and homely and great views.

Hotel is in the perfect location, a 5 minute walk from Stratford Train and Tube station with Westfield shopping centre on site and central line tubes running into Central London every few minutes.We arrived early but were able to check in straight away, and were given a studio suite on the 10th floor with views over London and the Olympic Park. Rooms have a kitchenette in them with cutlery, crockery, dishwasher, fridge and freezer so perfect for long stays. Room was spotlessly clean and had fantastic facilities. TV was of a good size and bed was comfy. Bathroom was lovely and shower was amazing! Had room service which comes from the Holiday Inn Below but it was of a good standard and there was quite a good selection of dishes on offer. Breakfast the next morning was exceptional - I would go as far to say it was the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. Didn't have to wait at all to be seated, even at peak times, and there was a huge selection of hot items (sausage, egg, hash browns, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms), pastries, breads, meats and cheeses, juices, teas and coffees. Breakfast room was lovely and light and had fantastic panoramic views over London - even better on a nice, clear day. Check-out was quick and efficient, and all of the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful - Especially a lady on front desk with pink/red hair (don't remember the name!) who looked after us spectacularly throughout our stay and made us feel extremely welcome.Overall a fantastic stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again if I was staying in London.",December 2013,5.0,28,Traveled with friends,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

We arrived into Kings Cross from Newcastle and rang the hotel ahead to see if we could check in early which they were more than happy to do and we also got a room looking over the Olympic stadium!!I've seen a few reviews complaining that there isn't much choice for breakfast which got me worried but on arrival into the kitchen area I was surprised to see a full English buffet, 2 coffee machines, toasters with every type of spread available, a fridge full of drinks to help yourself with and a island in the middle topped with yogurts, croissants, bagels, baguettes and fruit salads plus much more so I think maybe the posters about lack of food were slightly out of touch as I certainly couldn't fit anymore in after breakfast!!!The rooms themselves were fantastic. Every room has a kitchenette fully equipped with dishwasher, sink, hob, fridge, microwave (also a grill) plus glasses and cutlery pretty much everything you need to cook for yourself! We had a double suite so minus the living area but it was perfectly adequate for two people, along with a lovely bathroom and amazing shower!!! We stayed for the new year fireworks and were regularly travelling between hotel and Central London and found the 20 minute journey no problem at all!

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,boshamore,Beware - Group opening in Tibet despite ethical issues,"Before I write my review I want people to be aware that this hotel group is opening a hotel in Lhasa in illegally occupied Tibet and naming it Lhasa Paradise. There are so many human rights violations by China here & IHG are selling ""paradise"" branding which lines China's pockets through encouraging tourism and allows capitalism to further remove the culture of the Tibetan people. I'm saying that because if I had known I wouldn't have stayed here. What is happening to these people (and has happened) is atrocious and I want no part of it. Over 100 Tibetans have now self immolated (drank & dowsed themselves in petrol, then burned themselves alive) in protest. So now you roughly know too and if concerned can look into things yourself as you see fit. Again I stress to make your own opinion based on your own research and not take what I say for fact or complete truth. I may have made a mis-statement and would not falsely want to misrepresent the situation in Tibet or behavior of IHG. I just know those with ethical concerns would want this highlighted even if I put things ineptly. I stayed here with a friend in November. I stayed in one of the suites with both a bedroom and a living room. The bed was comfortable - enough so even for my friend that suffers from a mild hip problem (I am not a doctor or anything close - please don't take that as medical advice! Each person will feel different about the bed and should be advised suitably if they have any medical conditions). I had been expecting to be able to play movies on the tv in the bedroom but could only do so on the tv in the living room.The sofa is ok for two but you get squished in if you want to share it laying down. The view was down onto the Westfield Shopping Centre. (Just in case you are wondering - yes there is a primark in there).You really are right next to it. It's a five minute walk out the station and to the hotel. There are two exits from the train station but head to the Westfield Centre itself as sign posted. I am a nervous traveller but it wasn't hard to find at all. Once outside the Centre you will see directions to the hotel sign posted. It is just before John Lewis.On arrival you go up a lift. Another hotel operates on the lower floors. In reception you will be treated to two staff members that stand up to greet you which is a nice touch. Check in went very smoothly for me, fairly quick and they will mention an IHG Rewards Club you can sign up to. Movie night is also mentioned - one night a week they show a movie all guests can attend. It is usually advertised in the lift. As usual you get told breakfast times - oh and if you come in the afternoon a free cookie. I missed that cookie as I came slightly too early and never had chance to find an excuse to come back downstairs. It should be added reception staff are lovely. While you are checking in you can see down past an area you can buy some food and drinks (minimal amounts) as well as very basic toiletries. I didn't spy condoms so if you are their for fun make sure to pack them! The room is open plan and goes right down to the breakfast area and a small hanging out area. There is a balcony on the right where it is pleasant to look out over the surrounding area. It is all modern and tastefully decorated with daily papers adorning the tables to read.I remember thinking the shower was pretty good. I did not use the cooking in facilities but they looked well stocked. Everything was clean through out the room. What I did do was order in twice. The food however comes from the hotel below in the same building. It is meh. Normal British pub grub - I think they could have been better dishes. They suffice and are not bad but I know there is room for improvement. I had better food at the Premier Inn at London County Hall for example which is lower budget - but again food from downstairs hotel - not this chain. Also if you are up to it you have access to the shopping centres restaurants and there it pretty much caters for everything. I think their pantry could have been better stocked, it's nowhere near any close to a well stocked shop. If you plan on doing lots of cooking here bring what you want to cook from elsewhere.While I think of it if I was as a female travelling alone I would have felt safe here. Zero creepy vibes from employees. Also there is a beauticians in the building, something I had been unaware of. It is again downstairs with the other hotel.Breakfast! The breakfast room were food is laid out is fairly user friendly. Around the outskirts you have a hot food station with fry up items, there is a toaster, fridge containing a variety of fruit juices, a tea area, as well as shelves interspersed with glasses, condiments and other eating implements which you may help yourself too. There is an island in the middle which has muffins (blue berry and chocolate), small array of cereals, yogurt, milk, breads etc. I think there were a few cheeses and meats too. Oh and a few types of sweet pastries. I give a special shout out to those muffins though. They were good - very moist. You should hoard those. Trust me. Be careful of one of the hot food serving handles, it gets really hot. I think it was the beans handle but am not 100% sure. I told an employee and they were aware of the problem. They had moved food items around to resolve the issue but it ended up encouraging meat items to drop in veggie items like the beans so ended up back with a very hot serving handle on one dish. There were 4 employees there one morning, a very well supervised area. At the end of breakfast time they pack away sharp so be sure to get in and load up your plate if you want seconds! Next to the window is a nice place to sit if you like to gaze out and look at city landscape.You should have a pretty nice stay here. Only other thing I can think to mention is their website doesn't give as much detail to the hotel as say a non-chain would and that could be improved. I ended up moving to the London County Hall Premier Inn which is right by the London Eye. I had to extend my stay and the price here at short notice was overly high. They would not barter down enough to prolong my stay with them. Granted this is good value for London - with London being expensive but short notice it went up too much for me. I guess the cut in price is due to it being out of central London and not in a main tourist area. At the Premier Inn luxury was less of an issue as my company would not have been in the consideration in the same way. It was also a good central place to stay (but with no frills). If anyone has questions I'm happy to try and help. Enjoy your stay wherever you go.",November 2013,4.0,15,Traveled as a couple,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

I was hoping to get an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite with platinum status at IHG but they told me it was full.  10 seconds later on IHG.com, I see there are plenty of 1 bedroom suites available.  I suspect the reason was I paid the lowest category which was a studio suite and they didn't want to double upgrade me to the 1 bedroom type.However last time I stayed at the hotel, I booked the studio suite but I got the one bedroom suite at check in.  If they wanted me to pay a small supplement, they should have mentioned it.  I don't know why hotel staff think that a guest can't check online to see the availability of rooms?Anyway, the deluxe studio suite which I ended up getting is spacious and well appointed.  The bed is really big and the mattress is pretty good too. The bathroom isn't as nice as the 1 bedroom suite but it is fine.The complimentary breakfast is still a little bland in taste but thank goodness they got rid of those red plastic trays.  I would stay again at the hotel. It is very comfortable and well positioned in the Stratford Westfield mall.

We had a one bedroom suite on the 11th floor for 7 nights overlooking the Olympic stadium and, off in the distance, the London skyline. We could also just make out the London Eye.The suite was very comfortable with a well fitted out kitchen, adequate size lounge with comfortable furnishings, a large bedroom with large comfortable bed, 2 good size wardrobes and in room safe. The bathroom was quite large with a great shower over the bath. Free WiFi worked fine and we had no signal drop outs. The included smorgasbord breakfast was not the best or most varied we've ever had but it was adequate and did the job quit acceptably. Let's face it, we are not paying Ritz or Hilton prices, and the overall experience is better them anyway. Afternoon/night staff on reception sometimes appeared a little vague when asked for information but all the day staff were great, especially the young French guy (can't remember his name) who was particularly obliging helping me to print my airline boarding pass.   Being part of the Westfield shopping complex it's very convenient for all of your shopping needs and wants, including supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, fast food and fashion. Several train lines run through Stratford station which is virtually just across the road. There is also a major bus terminus out the front of the shopping center plus a taxi pickup/drop off area.

The only drawback is the approach by car as there is no direct access to the hotel and most taxi or limousine drivers have no idea where to drop you . It takes you a some time and asking around to get to the hotel and if you have a lot of luggage then it certainly becomes a problem. Going to the airport the best thing is to ask the concierge to arrange the car as they know where to come and your luggage can be taken by them to the car.We had arrived early morning at the hotel and the hotel tried their best to accommodate us by providing a room as soon as one became available and offered us to have breakfast while waited for our room.",November 2013,4.0,12,Traveled as a couple,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,chatthefoodie,Large room a luxury in London,"If you think the Staybridge Suites is not a luxury brand, well, the huge room that you get here might change your mind. I was totally surprised by the sheer size of my room here at the Stratford property. There was a living room, a fabulous, well-appointed kitchen, a large bedroom with an ultra-comfortable bed, and a sizable en suite bathroom. This was a far cry from the tiny, cramped rooms that you get in a London hotel. Sure, the location is not downtown, but the trade-off for the big room makes it a moot point in my book.This no-frills, low-service hotel is perfect for business travelers who just want to come back to sleep quietly each night. This is not ideal for families due to the lack of facilities, entertainment and noticeable luggage service staff. It is very good, however, for solo guests and shoppers who want the Westfield mall experience right next door. The Stratford tube station, DLR and bus depot within walking distance made commuting into London a breeze, though it does take time to get in and the transportation got crowded during rush hour. The hotel is not on the street, so this made getting into the building a chore if you have many bags to haul. Many taxi drivers did not know how to access it. You either take the train to Stratford station and walk a while, or take a taxi to the nearest point and walk a bit. Any method you choose requires some walking, so be prepared for that. That is another reason it is not great for families with kids and the elderly.The service was efficient and affable in a crisp sort of way. For this sort of accommodation, you do not expect family warmth but a more functional approach to hospitality, which Staybridge Suites Stratford handled very well.The 24-hour convenience store in the lobby is a wonderful concept, though what is on sale there is not cheap. With the fabulous kitchen you get with microwave oven, a dishwasher, and a full range of crockery and utensils you could ever hope for in a kitchen, you are tempted to at least mini-cook one meal. If you do not wish to not eat out at all, then Staybridge would be a perfect choice.I loved the extra comfortable bed, the sift pillows and the multi-channel television. The bathtub was a bit too high for me, but everything else in the bathroom was excellent.Overall, Staybridge Suites Stratford was fantastic value for money for me.

This wasn't a problem though being right in the heart of Westfield, so we left our bags and went for lunch and did some shopping before returning to get our keys to our room. The room was really clean and nicely furnished; our room was just a basic double room (with a queen sized bed I think) and there was apple TV, a desk and a fully functional kitchen (staybridge also has it's own shop in the lobby that sell ready meals, pizzas, bread, milk etc.) as well as all the usuals, ensuite etc. Bathroom was fab and modern with a big shower and all the soap type things. Access to the rooms was via keycard which also took you too your floor through use in the lift. I've seen some people comment on location being the only problem and although I can understand this may be the case for some people, we were in London for a surprise trip to see Les Miserables on the saturday evening and it was perfect for us - just getting the tube across the city - in fact it was so convenient we even went to a restaurant near Marble Arch via tube for sunday lunch also. 100% would recommend this hotel and location in Westfield perfect if you want to do some shopping and have lunch/dinner out (there's also many bars and a 24hr casino) -everything right on your doorstep but its still very secluded and private.(also we both had the best nights sleep ever on their beds, I don't know what it was but I woke up feeling as if I'd had the deepest nights sleep)",December 2012,5.0,21,Traveled as a couple,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

For people flying in – a taxi to the hotel would be £££’s.This is the first time we have stayed in a Staybridge in the UK - but have used them in USA. Hotel is fairly new and thus is in good order, nice fixtures and the 'home from home' environment was evident.Our room was £168 for one night – midweek rate booked 3 months in advance. That included a hot breakfast. Breakfast was fine - self service, limited buffet style but it does what a breakfast does.Hotel has a small fitness area and a laundry - so for longer stays in London I guess this would be ideal. Rooms are well appointed, bathroom has a shower and  small kitchenette means people could self cater - again, a plus for longer stays. Plenty of dining options in and out of the hotel.We did not receive any sort of upgrade for being platinum elite customers - I believe there are bigger rooms - but we were placed in standard studio one - clearly the hotel must have been full, and it is not a mandatory to upgrade - it is just we usually are, unless it is a stay on points, which this stay was not. We were given high speed internet access as part of being a platinum elite guest - and a cookie! Room styles are listed as studio king, deluxe studio king, standard suite and 1 bedroom suite with breakfast.  I am not sure if any of the rooms are able to accommodate any more than 2 people?The staff were lovely - though there was always a delay at reception -even though we didn't arrive till 7pm. Cleaning is at a very high standard. In short, if you are staying a few days in London - being a bit out of the centre, with a very flexible room would be very beneficial. Especially if you want to do some mall shopping & laundry!

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,RayCad,Gold medal award,"My wife and I stayed here a few days ago as a business trip with a couple of days pleasure tagged on.  It was a bit out of town compared to the usual central London location we pick but was handy for my conference.  But the really big plus for us was that it's only 6 minutes on the Javelin high speed train from St Pancras, where our train arrived (well Kings Cross really but it's almost the same) to Stratford International rail station. The Javelin runs about every 13 to 15 minutes.From that station to the Staybridge Suites is a 5 minute walk, almost completely indoors, via Westfield Shopping Centre, one level up from the lower ground where you enter from the station concourse.  The main Stratford underground/overground and DLR station is a 4 minutes walk in the other direction; the underground is served by the Central line, which takes you right into central London.Staybridge Suites is really just floors 8 to 11 of the Holiday Inn but it has its own dedicated check-inn.  The suites are like a studio timeshare, complete with microwave, fridge, kettle, sink etc.  The bathroom is done out in a nice contemporary marble, with a really good monsoon shower. It has a 42 inch flat screen TV and free Wi-Fi.  Breakfast was really good.  Maybe not quite up to Hilton standards but I did like the layout, where you got juices and milk from cartons in a refrigerated display rather than something resembling a giant tea urn.  The kitchen staff were friendly and kept everything spotlessly clean.  The breakfast area is on the 12th floor with a great view of the Olympic park (see photo), although it is bit like a building site just now as it is being redeveloped.  There's also a patio balcony for the warmer weather.The Westfield Centre is vast, with virtually all the major stores in residence.  It also had a good selection of restaurants - we dined one night at Jamie's Italian which is a one minute walk straight out the front door of the hotel, directly ahead.   I also like the combination of indoor and outdoor layout of the Westfield - must be good in the summer.We will definitely stay here again when we next come to London.

It's a trek from the downtown tourist stuff and the airports (other than City Airport), so it's not a great place to stay absent a reason to be in the area.",October 2013,3.0,100,Traveled solo,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

The room 915  was one of the best I have stayed  perfect bed, good powerful shower, good flat TV screen and excellent quality mini kitchen. Staff was very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was first class. I have taken  stars away for the following issues I asked for my room to be cleaned on the weekend and on the Saturday this was not done I had to bring this to the attention of reception on Saturday night to make sure it would be cleaned on the Sunday. Be warned on their credit card policy  I had booked online and took the flexible rate . On arrival I was told I should settle my bill on departure and was asked to swipe my credit card for authentication. When checking out I paid my bill of 432 pounds using the same credit card. That night when I arrived home  I checked my credit card statement online and found out I has 480 pounds on hold on my card from my arrival at the hotel  as well as the 432 pounds I had paid to settled my account at departure . It was five days before the 480 pounds was released back to me. To me this is unacceptable,  I will stick to Premier Inn and travel lodge for any short term stays in London as they are more transparent and upfront when you hand over your credit card .

I find it hard to think of another hotel in London which offers such a quality experience at such a reasonable rate.The rooms were spacious, exceptionally clean and modern in design. Each room has a kitchenette which is a great bonus, although with so many restaurants nearby you won't really need to use it. If you do want to make a snack, there is a small shop right by the reception.There was a huge selection at breakfast and set us up for the day. Complimentary tea and coffee is served in the Den throughout the day and evening and although we did not experience it because we stayed at the weekend, there is complimentary cheese and wine on weekday evenings.What set this hotel apart was the staff - we could not have been made to feel more welcome. They were all friendly, cheerful and helpful. We would like to give a special mention to Timothy who went above and beyond the call of duty, helping us set up the Apple TV in our room and chatting to us about the NFL match at Wembley that we were in London to see. Give that man a pay rise!The hotel is ideally placed - far enough away from the bustle of Central London but also just a short Tube ride away when you want to be in the thick of it.

The hotel was in a great location in terms of access to Central London and the Westfield shopping centre. It's was great to have a choice of restaurants on the door step. Now for the unfortunate negatives. We had a far from peaceful night. Although being on the 10th floor there was the unwelcome noise of drunkards and party goers from the adjacent bars and casino throughout most of the night. The rooms failed to keep this noise out. This was raised with reception on booking out, they advised that they would make a note on their systems so we would be placed on the other side of the hotel on our next visit. The only other negative was the hot buffet breakfast was more of lukewarm and of poor quality. The fresh cold items were great and, again the homely set up was refreshing compared to the usual hotel feel.

It was spacious, excellent quality and with a small kitchenette (which I didn't use, but it looked excellent; if you do want to self-cater there is an M&S nearby). Breakfast was a self-serve buffet that provided a huge range of choices and the full works if you wanted it. I am a person who dislikes formality; I do not wish to pay for staff to bow and scrape before me and always prefer self-serve if it is available. I just want the service I request delivered pleasantly. So for me, this place is perfect. If you want bowing,scraping and fetching, this is not the place for you!

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,ABRC,A brilliant home-from-home,"We needed a hotel with parking for one night, as we had a family commitment in east London. I'd never heard of Staybridge Suites, and I didn't know there were any hotels in the Westfield Centre at Stratford. This was the perfect solution for us. Parking is just £5 for 24 hours (as long as you don't move your car out of the car park and return: it's £5 for the first two hours, then free for 22 hours, but if you leave and return you pay another £5 for the first two hours after returning). The one-bedroom apartment we had enjoyed a stunning view over the Olympic Park. It was superbly comfortable, and of course everything is brand new and fresh. The bedroom, bathroom and lounge area were larger than in standard hotel accommodation, and having the kitchenette (complete with fridge, microwave and dishwasher) was fantastic. There's loads of storage space, and the decor is stylishly understated in warm colours. I can't praise the staff highly enough. It's obvious that they're chosen and trained for their customer care skills. Because this is a place where many guests spend weeks at a time, the staff need to be able to deal with a wider range of issues than on a standard hotel reception desk, and their friendliness and helpfulness were outstanding. Rafal Wasiluk, the Operations Manager, was very helpful in responding to my email enquiries before arrival, and was there with a smile and a cheery greeting when we checked in. Nicolas on reception checked us in efficiently, and later was very helpful in resolving some wifi access issues. Thanks go to both of them.Breakfast is included, and it's an impressive spread. Fruit compote, fresh fruit salad, cereal, yogurt, croissants, pastries, plus hot bacon, sausages, omelettes and hash browns. A better selection of jam would be nice (there was only one - squeezable strawberry), but this is a minor quibble.The shower was powerful, which was great. I noted the helpful environmental gesture of refillable large bottles of shower gel, shampoo and conditioner; it's good to see the hotel taking this issue seriously. The room was extraordinarily quiet; we heard no exterior noise at all. The blackout curtains worked very well, too. The bed was very comfortable, but unfortunately the pillows were hard and uncomfortable; it would have been good to have a choice of soft or hard pillows available. That's my only criticism; otherwise, this stay would have been perfect.Being on top of the Westfield facilities was brilliant. We shopped, ate, and saw a film, all on our doorstep. This would be a great base for seeing more of London, but for our purposes it worked really well not having to go further than five minutes' walk for dining and entertainment.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,micheleshdwfx,Good value,"Keep in mind that it is a good value because it is not in central London.  When we tried to get a cab at Heathrow upon our arrival, the first cabbie looked at us as if we were nuts.  Too far and no way he could do that.  Luckily we found a driver who would take the fare (115 pounds plus a small tip!).  We were tired and just wanted to get to our destination.  Happily, upon leaving we found a nearby car service that picked us up and took us back to the airport for a mere 50 pounds.)  So then once we were where the hotel was supposed to be it was a nightmare trying to find it.  You have to go up *into* the shopping mall area to get there.  I am not sure if we overlooked directions for that but it was very frustrating, especially when you are tired from travelling.  So if you are ok with the time it takes (anywhere from maybe 20 minutes to 40 minutes minus the walk from your hotel room to the tube station) to get into London, the hotel is good.  It was clean, which is of course one of the most important elements, and the desk clerks were very polite and helpful.  Breakfast comes with which is nice but don't be too picky......cereal, bread, pastries, eggs (which I really didn't care for - they seemed like powdered eggs maybe?) and I think fruit and yogurt.  That'll do if you are on a budget.  Now the upside of the location was that it was in a mall also.  Many places to eat, including supermarkets where we could shop to cook/eat in our room to save money on a couple of meals.  When my watch broke and my feet hurt, I quickly replaced the shoes (Skechers) and watch (Swatch) with new ones on our way to the tube station.  I think we might try to up the budget and stay closer to London if we went back but if not, we would stay here again.",May 2013,4.0,51,Traveled as a couple,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

The room was great and the Tue-Thu ""manager's social"" was a nice touch (unlimited beer/wine and snacks for an hour).It wasn't perfect though. I hate it when hotels charge for wifi. OK, wifi is free, but it's slow (ie. deliberately slowed down to a certain limit) and you have to pay £7.50 for 24 hrs of fast wifi. My other slight gripe is that I was given a disability room and told that this is what I'd booked. I hadn't.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,sbendernd,"No Driveway Access - Other Service ""Hiccups""!","Truth be known, I was biased toward giving this property a 4 point rating – at minimum – from the start, based on glowing reviews from TripAdvisor.  However, too many unfortunate “hiccups” along the way – during our 5 night stay! – accumulated to bring the overall assessment down a couple of pegs?To start, we had a bit of an awkward experience attempting to reach the hotel lobby area itself?!  Specifically, I sort of realized – based on TripAdvisor info – that the hotel had no direct driveway access.  But I wasn’t 100% certain what to expect?  And neither did the airport transfer service we hired to take us there?  So we ended up having to drive through a large short-term pay garage to the foot of an escalator bank, which led, in turn, up to an open Westfield shopping mall plaza area.  So the hotel itself is literally in the middle of a shopping mall.  Thereupon we were responsible for lugging our heavy luggage (LOL) the remainder of the way (approximately an American football field’s length in distance – 50 yards!) to the ground level of the property – which was curiously where the concierge station was located.  It was also isolated from the main check-in area which was another elevator’s ride away… up on the 12th floor!  Alternatively, a 2nd elevator bank on the ground level took one up to the 3rd floor check-in area for the Holiday Inn, as the two properties (H. Inn and Staybridge Suites) share the same building in common – just different “towers”.  So first tip for anybody reading this…is that it’s highly recommended that you coordinate transportation arrangements beforehand directly with the hotel – even if you’re making independent preparations!   At the very least they can provide guidance on the most convenient drop off /pick up points (i.e. – the Cow Pub on the shopping center’s perimeter it turns out!) and/ or arrange for bell hop assistance, to help avoid the types of logistical challenges we encountered.On that note, the staff there was exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  Upon check-in they informed us straight away about the free wine and cheese event for hotel guests held every Tuesday – Thursday evenings from 6:30-7:30 p.m., which was an unexpected perk.  We also unexpectedly found out that the daily breakfast there was complimentary for ALL guests – which said so right there on the room entry cards!   This news was a bit of a surprise for us, as we’d paid extra for breakfast inclusion through our EXPEDIA booking.  Thus be cautious of web sites which improperly charge extra for this?The room itself was a bit on the compact side, as far as “suites” go anyway?  However, it was fully equipped with a full complement of cooking utensils, silverware, plates, fridge, microwave, etc., …anything suitable for a standard level of apartment living.  On the downside, though, there were remnants of leftover food from the prior tenant’s stay, remaining in the refrigerator;  AND the living room T.V. – a really nice Sony flat screen I might add – wouldn’t work (although the bedroom T.V. was fully functional).  Add to this the disappointing view we had of air ducts and pipes from the roof top of the adjoining building.  Unfortunately, all rooms overlooking Olympic Park were taken, although we’d requested upon booking.  Anyway, all of this contributed to a rather unsettling “break in” period.  Good news, though, was that following our first 2 nights there (out of 5) the front desk actually honored our request for a room with Olympic Park view, after we’d largely relinquished hope that this would ever occur.  Thus, it was a pleasant surprise, as we hadn’t pressed the matter at all, beyond casually mentioning our desire for a potential room change on day 1.Elsewise the Staybridge Suites’ East London – Stratford City location certainly offered up a veritable shopper’s and gambler’s mecca.  Because as previously mentioned, it sits smack dab in the midst of what happens to be Europe’s largest shopping center – the New Westfield Shopping Mall;  and is additionally a foot bridge’s walk away from the Stratford Centre…the latter of which is home to a number of discount retailers and individual vendors who set up shop there during the day, peddling their various wares.  Both malls are home to convenient grocery stores – which we took full advantage of.  But Stratford Centre is certainly a more economical alternative to the pricier Westfield facility.  Topping this off – for those who have a gambling interest! – was the Aspers Casino, which was literally only a stone’s throw away from the hotel.  There was also a myriad of various ethnic restaurants and countertop service eateries (within the Westfield’s food court) practically just outside of the property as well.  In fact, we had dinner twice at “The Real Greek” restaurant which offered up a nightly discounted fixed price menu.  You can also get a coupon book offering restaurant and retailers’ discounts directly from the mall.  So be on the lookout for this!Transportation access from the Staybridge to Central London was relatively uncomplicated as the extensive London Metro tube (underground) and over ground combined Stratford station was literally 3-5 minutes walking distance away…depending on your gait I suppose?  LOL.  However, it may require as many as 10 stops (20-25 minutes total) – with a transfer possibly sandwiched in between – to reach some of the more popular tourist destinations from Stratford City.  So just an FYI!Switching focus back to the property itself, the daily breakfast was generally provided from 6:30-9:30 a.m. with a 7:30 a.m. start on Saturday (unsure about Sunday)!  It featured all of the standard continental breakfast fare (croissants, juices, cereal, bananas, etc.), typically served in conjunction with baked beans, slab bacon (very salty), pork sausage and either scrambled eggs and or cheese omelets.  And to reiterate, it’s absolutely free to all guests.  YAY! The Staybridge also advertises free laundry facility usage for guests…which was factual.  What they didn't tell you, though, was that they also have the slowest washer /driers in the world!  So a single load of clothes requires upwards of 3 hours to completion – no exaggeration!  And then you have to continually check back to ensure that other guests haven’t set any unattended laundry – possibly your own! – aside, which we discovered they were wont to do!And for those of us who further desired to utilize their advertised free 24 hour internet service, the front desk attendant informed – with a straight face -  that we could do so in their “business center”?!  LOL…  Well it turns out that the “business center” was comprised of 2 lonely p.c. terminals sitting in the 3rd floor lobby of the Holiday Inn;  which meant down to the ground floor (from level 12) and up the adjoining elevator bank  to their “sister” property.  And as it was evening at the time, there was barely enough overhead lighting to view the p.c.’s keyboards at all.  Thus  you’re  sitting there enveloped in virtual darkness,  or extremely dim lighting, at best…to be generous!  When I mentioned to the Holiday Inn desk attendant,  she intoned that lights are turned down by management in the evenings and she had no authority to turn them up.  What in the world?!  LOL.  However, the final insult to injury was that the machines were EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW – to the point of being nearly unusable in fact!  Turns out, I could only frustratingly use the infernal devices for checking emails…and this was after waiting for seemingly interminable lengths of time for the websites to pull up on screen.  Whenever I tried to SEND messages, however, I received irreconcilable ERROR messages, due to systems overload, or some other mysterious root cause.  Same thing when I tried to book tours online.  And the staff could provide zero assistance in resolving.  Thus, in short, the “business center” there was extremely inadequate at best and pretty much bordering on a total embarrassment, that management sorely needs to attend to.  Otherwise, perhaps you’d enjoy better success – or maybe not?!  LOL. - by bringing your own notebooks for interface to their WIFI network as an alternative?However, additionally worth mentioning is that the Staybridge apparently DOESN’T PROVIDE regular housekeeping services on weekends…based on signage posted in the rooms?!  But I wasn’t entirely clear on what the property’s philosophy was behind this, and would advise validating their actual policy with them directly…lest I miscommunicate.  But as we were only there during the week – with a Saturday a.m. departure – we weren’t around to experience this first hand. Speaking of departure, we had another nightmarish adventure upon checking out of the hotel.  Specifically, despite our best efforts in precisely describing the locale of the hotel to our airport transport provider – they totally bungled the pickup point nonetheless and ended up in Central London somewhere!  As again, it is a bit confusing if you’re not familiar with the area and layout there.  So we waited outdoors in the heavy drizzle and chill for nearly an hour prior to finally having to defer to the Staybridge concierge to call us a taxi – which was another hour’s drive and 60 British Pounds to Heathrow.  We only made our international flight back to the U.S. by some miracle of fate (i.e. – airline personnel actually delayed the plane’s scheduled gate “pull away” time in anticipation of our hectic and sweaty late arrival)!  But just further reinforcement for having the Staybridge staff itself help negotiate the property’ inevitable logistics challenges associated with finding your way to and from the property!In closing – finally – we’d likely consider staying here, going forward – excluding weekends perhaps…LOL! – from a simple price / value perspective alone.  But there is definitely room for improvement!",June 2013,3.0,28,Traveled as a couple,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Kajji,Very good choice if you want to shop in one centre and be close to a place that hosts mega concerts.,"The hotel itself is situated in an ideal position. We chose Staybridge because it was close to where Michael Buble was in concert at the O2. Therefore meaning that we were also close to public transport. (We were at the O2 in fifteen minutes circa and we made it back in less than thirty). The fact that all kinds of fashion houses etc are under one roof and within a five minutes' walk, is perfect. Even the restaurants are that close, which is a bonus. The hustle and bustle of London and Westminster is thirty mins away. Calming Cambridge is an hour's train away. The only things that disappointed me slightly were:- -The fact that the rooms do not shut the noise totally from outside, even though they are twelve floors high! So one hears the humming of the machinery on the roof tops of the shopping complex as well as the voices of the event direction guides speaking on their megaphones in a muffled way that can still disturb your sleep. -the fact that the air conditioning unit within the room is not a quiet one and the building within itself does echo other residents' voices and movements in certain areas. -as soon as we entered our room we found an open bar of chocolate in its wrapper; half eaten and a stained foot runner on the bed which we obviously attribute to human error due to the busy custom of the hotel. (But it was still distasteful at first impact)The above reasons is why I rated my stay as an overall very good otherwise I would have rated all as excellent.",July 2013,4.0,9,not mentioned,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,-1
Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,6shot,"It is decided, probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in","And I will break it down why. So what are the things that most of the people of all ages look at when staying in an hotel?Bed comfort, room isolation, room cleanliness, quality of service at the front desk, room service, room contents, showers, quality of sleep, WiFi, location, breakfast, view from the room and maybe a fitness center.Pretty much in every single category this hotel deserves a top rating, maybe except the location, but even then it is conveniently located as almost a part of the Westfield mall, where you can get whatever you need. The tube is located just at the other exit from the mall.The bed was very comfortable, the room was very well isolated and clean. The quality of service was absolutely spotless, the people at the desk really knew how to approach their clients and perhaps the ""TripAdvisor 2013 Winner"" badge at the reception is a good motivation for the people working there. The room had a small, but sufficient fridge, a stove and a microwave, which struck me as a surprise considering that this is a pretty expensive hotel. And expensive hotels don't usually provide this type of service counting on people ordering food from the astronomically priced restaurant. Koodos for that. Showers were well lighted, comfortable and clean. Besides the numerous TV channels, the actual Samsung TV was also equipped with the Apple TV add-on and access to YouTube.Another problem I have with most of the expensive hotels is the fact that you have to pay for the WiFi access or the access is so inconvenient that you rather not use it at all. This is where this hotel also has pleasantly surprised me. Strong WiFi signal on all of the floors and only once you walk out of the lobby, your signal is completely lost which disables the people passing by to obtain the connection, which is a smart thing to do. WiFI access doesn't require any personal information and it is a straightforward open connection.From the room I could see a pretty nice view on London and a view on the Olympic Stadium. To get anywhere on the elevator, you must have your room card available, otherwise you'll be waiting for quite a while, which is a very good security measure, I find.The breakfast was the last contribution to winning me over. The large kitchen setting provided a large choice of breakfast to anyone's taste. Even my brother, who eats breakfast about couple times a year, actually picked up a few things at the buffet and enjoyed a nice scenery from the 12th floor of the hotel. Mind you, there is nothing very luxurious about this hotel, but it is definitely worth the price paid.Prior to our stay at this hotel, we spent 3 nights camping at the Download Festival in Donnington, so to have a bed and so many convenient services was a real blessing at that point.Most of the hotels in London are quite expensive, but if you don't mind throwing some more money to get this type of great service, I think it is well worth it. Taking all these factors into consideration, I actually think that this is probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in (moving Hilton Lac-Leamy in Gatineau to the 2nd spot)",June 2013,5.0,177,Traveled with family,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

There are signages however, we found it difficult to locate the hotel. This is something that the hotel staff should better. We entered through the parking area and it took us some time before we could figure it. The easiest entry is on the road from front of Olympic park. The best part is that you don't have to climb stairs/ escalators etc since it is at the same level. The other way is to get down in front of the mall next to the tube station and take the lift to 1 floor and walk towards the open area. The hotel is right above Holiday Inn with a common entry but separate lifts. It is opposite the diesel and prada stores. The hotel is very nice. Rooms clean with all amenities available.

He went out of his way to help me when I was having major issues trying to get Dominos to deliver a pizza!!!The property is absolutely brilliant, well appointed and for London HUGE!  The kitchenette was well laid out and makes your stay more of a 'home away from home' than a hotel stay.  The room was spotlessly clean and I had a brilliant view of the Olympic stadium.Given that it is an apartment more than a hotel the Waitrose and M&S located inside Westfiled shopping centre of which the hotel is part make buying groceries exceptionally easy.  If you don't feel like cooking there are a number of great restaurants in the centre for you to choose from.Don't be put off by zone 3 on the tube - you have national rail, Overground, Underground, DLR and more to choose from in terms of getting around.  Central line to central London took me 20 minutes to meet family for dinner and the Jubilee line to Canary Wharf was no more than 15 minutes to meet a colleague.  As I said in the heading it is surprisingly well-located.  I met family to attend an event at Twickenham and used the Overground service.  Again easy to use and navigate...  I actually think that the hotel is better-placed than many central London hotels from a transport perspective (the only downside being the GBP50 taxi journey from Paddington after the Heathrow Express).On the down-side, mainly small things:-  hooks on the bathroom door to hang towels would be a great addition-  the 'gym' is more of a 'fitness room' and desperately needs to be better equipped.  There are 2 treadmills, a stationery cycle, a seated cycle, a non-moveable bench and an odd assortment of dumbbells.  It needs at least a cross-fit multi-purpose type machine to be even vaguely useful a and there is no alternative close by!-  be aware that the drop-off is in the street and that you have to walk with your luggage to the hotel as there is no place for direct drop-off (this is a MAJOR design flaw!)-  healthier breakfast options - no muesli or granola that I could see... no oats... hot stuff is all pre-prepared (and the eggs/omelette looked grim)...Having said all of that it was a great stay for 5 days and I will definitely be back!",May 2013,5.0,63,Traveled solo,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Despite being away from the city, Staybridge Stratford prime location with views of the Olympic Park, and the huge Westfield Stratford shopping mall just next door, makes this accomodation one of the best in London.For business travellers, if your offices are in Canary Wharf financial area, it will be worth staying at Staybridge. With free internet and breakfast (albeit a simple continental one),  free laundry room for guests, and nice sunset views from the lounge (or room if you are facing the park), it is a definite home-away-from-home location.Kudos to the reception staff are always very friendly and helpful, regardless of time of the day and queries from guests. Housekeeping is good, and rooms are nicely cleaned daily.Whether you are here for business or pleasure, the huge Westfield Stratford has everything you need - from big branded and luxury wear and fashion, to many fusion and local restaurants, bars and cafes, it definitely caters to all walks of life.  There is also a huge VUE cinemas for those looking to catch up with big screen shows.  The hotel and Westfield is easily accessible via DLR or tube, or if you are coming from central London, there is the express National Rail that connects Stratford to Central London.A point to note though, is that it gets really REALLY crowded on weekends.",January 2013,5.0,83,Traveled as a couple,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

The entire complex is immaculately clean, the staff helpful and the rooms well serviced. Each room as a good sized  bathroom two TV’s  and the usual serviced apartment cooking and washing facilities. Parking is only GBP 5 a day, which for London is a huge bargain.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Jasmine DR,A really pleasant stay.,"Booked a weekend stay using their special Weekender price, which allows you to cancel your booking up until 4pm on Thursday, which I think is pretty good and would recommend. Anywho, back to the hotel itself. Didn't have too much trouble finding the place, although the signs in the Westfield Carpark could have been a little better, but I guess that's not the hotel's fault. The receptionist on the phone was really helpful.Arriving at the building situated out on The Street at Westfield, you are greeted by friendly staff and have to take an elevator to the top floor to reception. The whole hotel was spotless; faultless in fact? The room we had was facing the city, with fantastic views over London. The skyline at night is absolutely beautiful. The room was fairly big, clean and furnished pretty well. We booked a normal King Size room, so was equipped with a mini kitchenette area, which was cute. The shower/wet room was pretty generous, and the water pressure really good, which was a plus, I enjoyed a really nice shower in the morning. Also comes with your usual washing/shower products, such as shampoo and conditioner, but I brought my own anyway. There's a hair dryer in the room too, which was handy. The free Wi-Fi wasn't great, it was quite slow at times and you couldn't really stream anything properly without it breaking up at times. You can upgrade to the option premium internet, however with the price we paid for the room and the feel of the hotel, you'd expect that sort of internet access to be included. The hotel has a 'business class' feel to it, so I suspect it appeals to a lot of business travelers. Again, just furthering the need for higher speed internet access. Apple TV in the room too, but again you need to upgrade to the higher internet, so that was a little disappointing. Breakfast in the morning was to a good standard, however, we were disappointed with the lack of bacon. Although we thought there could have been more variety in the way of hot food, there is an extensive range of cereals, breads, croissants, fruit etc that you can help yourself to. Oh, also really liked the 'home from a home' feel to the restaurant area - it's basically a kitchen you can help yourself too: you can make your own coffee, toast, etc - so that felt pretty homely. So, yeah, only criticism is that they could have offered a wider variety of hot foods - overheard another guest asking about beans? Be sure to check out the balcony in the dining area - some fantastic views, and luckily we enjoyed some sunshine so was really lovely to enjoy a coffee out there in the morning. Would probably stay again, it did the job and it did it well. I would say it lived up to my expectations and was a good price for what it was. The staff are really friendly, the breakfast is good and included in your room price, noise levels are low and we had a really comfortable room.

Very pleased until entering the bathroom only to find a patch of dried on crusty urine under the toilet seat! yuk!! I called the receptionist who said "" sorry""  (and not much else) and sent a couple of girls to our room to clean.

The second girl got her toilet brush and brushed and swilled all around the inside of the toilet then proceeded to scrub the floor and the toilet flusher with the same brush without even rinsing or cleaning it! this was enough to put me off staying there ever again! absolutely disgusting hygiene levels and makes me wonder what they do when you are not there if that's what you see when you are.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,kan_rach,Excellent for Long Term Stay,"I was fairly skeptical when I saw the sign ""Welcome Home"", as I stepped into their reception the first time. It didn't take too long to identify with it, though! Hotel is in a fantastic location both in terms of the immediate environment (new and huge mall, lots of restaurants with variety of cuisines, cinema theatre, casino et al) as well as connectivity (5 mins. walk to the Stratford station, which is a junction of so many lines that you can reach most parts of London with ease). One thing to keep in mind though - the building is in the middle of several blocks of restaurants and the mall - so the taxi goes as far as the Westfield Chestnut Plaza Restaurants board - with Busaba Eathai on one side and The Cow on the other... you would need to walk it (less than a minute) to the hotel itself from this point.Rooms are fairly spacious and clean and come with all necessary amenities for a comfortable long stay (kitchenette with hob, dishwasher, fridge, toaster, microwave, kettle and basic crockery and cutlery). Views from the room could be towards the mall or looking out towards the city - the latter is absolutely incredible, especially at night with the twinkling skyline, the green laser beam of the GMT line, the trains doing their busy runs and so on (ask for a city-view when you book). In-room amenities are standard. They provide Apple TV (at extra charges) but the basic TV channels were more than enough. Free wireless and wired internet connections within the room, but if you need to stream videos, you will have to upgrade to the faster and paid internet. Wardrobe plus drawer space was ok but could be better. Basic toiletries provided - I liked the low-waste approach where they don't provide the little vanity kits, instead have big bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel - just like at home. Carry your own lotions, though.The 12th (top) floor hosts their reception area, gym (comfortable for 3-4 people to work out at the same time), laundry room, pantry, breakfast area and the ""den"". I loved the den! It's a cosy room at the end of the floor, with a big TV, a little ""library"" (just a handful of books but enough), board games and multiple points where you can plug in your laptop. They host a movie once a week in the den too, complete with popcorn to go. Socials are ok with the wine / beer / sodas and cheeses, olives and salads, chips, breads and pâté. But easily, the winner is their complimentary breakfast - with a spread of hot and cold, veg and non-veg items, from fruits to cereals to eggs to sausages to yogurt to croissants etc., there are enough options to choose from and it's all yummy too, though one may tire of it after 2 long months :). Another convenient thing was a 24 hours tea/coffee availability, though one needed to go to the 12th floor for this. But it was nice to be able to get my cuppa literally anytime, complete with honey to go! And all this at no extra charge made this one of the best value-for-money places by far!Also, the hotel folks are really nice, friendly and very helpful - when I needed to get printouts and scans in the middle of the night and their own scanner was not functioning suitably, they went down to their other hotel (Holiday Inn), got it done without my having to run around one bit!

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,3KMax,Very good value overlooking Olympic park,"This was an experiment that worked. I stayed 3 nights, mix of business and pleasure, and was worried about how much time it would take to get to and from Stratford to City, Marble Arch and Hammersmith. On average I got door to door in about 30 mins - which was better than I had expected.Hotel does the things I value well. Suites are slightly larger than average hotel room. Bed is comfortable and pillows well above average. Room is dark (or was on olympic stadium side). Windows open (hoorah) and even then noise was very minimal for London, just the odd train creaking away below but quiet through small hours. All in all a pleasant place with clean bathroom and very good shower pressure. I can recommend highly especially for anything south of £140 per night.They throw breakfast in ...which is just as well as it is not as good as the room you just vacated ! Limited and bland cooked with sub par sausages and overcooked beans..plus egg omelettes. I did like the homely attempt at presenting cereals, jams, juices etc as you would have them from larder/ cupboard at home but the experience scores a 6/10 at best. Many might prefer Costa coffee close to hotel entrance.Apart from one missed wake up call (overcomplicated telephone system) - the experiment worked and sadly I have to recommend it highly, which will probably push prices up to a point where the hotel no longer remains good value.

Flat screens in both the bedroom and living room with satellite TV. A great place for families - We had spent our first 3 days in London at a very Centrally located hotel, so we were able to get all of the typical sightseeing when we were local. While at Staybridge, we did remote locations like Hampton court and StoneHenge so being a distance from central london was not too much of an issue. This was a nice place for when we wanted some downtime, with shopping, bowling and spending time at the hotel (although I wish there was a pool). Great common area upstairs and a very nice, homestyle kind of breakfast. Great value for the price. This was definitely the most comfortable hotel we stayed at during our trip to London and Paris and it was the least expensive. A fair trade off for the somewhat out of the way location.The cons: 1. No one made our room -- we were told they were short staffed over the Easter holiday. We were given fresh towels upon request, but that was it. 2. it is 1/2 hour away via the tube to central London. Days when we were tired it was tough to take the long ride back. That also meant a long (and expensive) cab fare from the train station and to Heathrow.3. Concierge was sick one day and we got some misinformation from his fill in, which caused us to miss a tour -- I'm sure that's an isolated incident however.",March 2013,4.0,26,Traveled with family,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

Firstly, I was in a room which was below the gym, not a very good idea to put the gym above where people are staying/sleeping as it is quite disruptive when others are using a treadmill and throwing weights on the floor early in the morning or when you just want to relax!!!! Perhaps if they offered a price reduction for those rooms which suffer from the noise and vibrations from the treadmills it might be a good idea. I did go to reception about this but I wasn't offered another room. Next, the hygiene wasn't very good in the kitchen area i.e dirty crockery and cutlery. There were also parts of the room that looked like they needed finshing off. The ratings I have given reflect my views of the 2nd stay.

Taking the express lift up to the top floor where the reception is situated, we were greeted by happy smiling receptionists who not only processed you, but also made you feel welcome. We asked if they had any rooms overlooking the Olympic Park and they were only too pleased to find us a fantastic room (1001) that not only looked over the Stadium and ArcelorMittal Orbit, but we also had views of the Shard, O2 arena (Millennium Dome) and Canary Wharf.The room had a comfortable king size bed, shower bathroom, flat screen TV and small kitchenette with all the essentials (Hob, Microwave, Sink, Etc.).Breakfast the next morning was unexpectedly good, lots of choice and tasty with a vast range of cereals, fruit, bread, juices and yogurts.

The location is excellent - it didn't take long on the tube to get to the O2 and being at the Westfield Centre meant that we could step out of the hotel and into the shops and restaurants.  Reception staff were lovely and I was impressed by the breakfast offering.  We had initially been concerned by the lack of a bar or restaurant but were happy to cross the corridor and eat/drink at the Holiday Inn as we had the ability to charge it to our room.Perhaps the only complaint was the badgering of the housekeeper in the morning.  We had put our do not disturb sign on the door the night before but it disappeared by the morning.  In any event, it seems odd to me that they cannot simply be updated by reception when people have checked out so that they stop knocking on the door every half an hour and querying when you plan on leaving when it isn't even check out time yet!

It was very safe to walk to and from the station and mall at night.   Saturday night was a little noisy due to the fact that our room faced the Casino and there was a bar that had an outdoor area that was pretty lively.The hotel staff was wonderful and  helpful with any questions or concerns we had. The room was spotless except for the lower portion of the window which was covered with children's hand prints. The complimentary breakfast offered a nice selection of hot and cold foods  and allowed us to start the day well-nourished.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Joseph B,A Good Deal Near the ExCel Centre,"Recently, I needed to attend a trade show at London's ExCel Centre.  As its on the opposite side of London from where I live, I like to get a hotel room at ExCel, or nearby, whenever I am attending for more than one day, or with an early start.  Unfortunately, on this occassion, I got approval so late, to attend the show, that all the hotels at ExCel were sold out...except one: the Premier Inn.  I've stayed in Permier Inn's before and they're okay, but very basic.   On their website, they quoted me an astronomical price and I didn't want to pay that much for a Premier Inn.  Luckily, the Intercontinental Group came to the rescue. As a Priority Club member, I had their site open, because I had wanted to stay at the Crowne Plaza at ExCel.  The Crowne Plaza showed nothing available, but the Holiday Inn Express, Docklands, was an alternative.  I'd prefer a Holiday Inn Express to the Premier Inn and the Holiday Inn Express was cheaper, but not much.  Also, it's one stop away from the ExCel on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR).  I've stayed at that Holiday Inn Express before and It's a decent hotel, but it's a bit in the middle of nowhere, after hours.  Also, the price quoted was high, probably because of the show at the ExCel.  But, further down the list of Intercontinental properties was the Staybridge Suites at Startford City.  It's a higher level of property and they were quoting a lower price.  Staybridge opened in time for the 2012, London Olympics.  Now that the Olympics are over and it being winter in London, I guess it wasn't too busy.  Staybridge is only 2 stop on the DLR and 2 more stops on the Jubilee Line from ExCel.  Also, the overnight parking chrages are only £5 per 24 hours, at Staybridge, while the Holiday Inn Express Docklands was quoting £10.  Staybridge is part of the Stratford City complex, co-located with a Holiday Inn, alongside the Westfield Mall.  Wesfield has restaurants, a food court, and a Vue Cinema, along with loads of shops.As an all suites hotel, Staybridge has nice rooms, with a fully functional kitchen.  Free, hot breakfast buffet was included, as well as a free wine and beer session, each weeknight.  Good quality, cold, Becks beer on tap for the evening mixer, also free nibbles, just add to the value of a stay here.  The staff were very friendly and positive.  I was given a room with a view of the Olympic Park.The only negatives I found were small things, which made it slightly less than perfect.  The closet is small and because the in-room safe is set on too high a pedestal, inside the closet, Long items can't hang in the closet.  Also, I had trouble finding a power plug near the bed.  On one side, the cordless phone uses the plug, while on the other the clock is plugged in.  Eventually, I found anotehr plug...behind the bed heaboard!  It was in a very awkward position to use.  In the bathroom, the hand towel is on a railing below the sink.  It's too low and when I had to bend over to use the towel, it semed to be at the exact height to cause an uncomfortable feeling in my lower back.  The shower drained slowly, so I ended up standing in a puddle of water, at the end of each shower.  They give you a free, basic wifi, but offer a higher speed version, if you pay, as part of a package with Apple TV.  I stuck with the free version and found it mostly adequate, if ocassionally slow.  Ample shower gel is provided, but, personally, I prefer bar soap to shower gel.  They did give a small bar of soap for hand washing.  Finally, the hot brekfast food seemed below the quality level of the rest of the hotel.  Despite these small flaws, I enjoyed my stay.  The property is new and looks it.  It definitely worth it for me to stay there, saving over £30 per night, for a better class of property.",February 2013,4.0,539,Traveled on business,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

First of all, the hotel is new and is located in Europe's largest shopping mall. Even if you don't like shopping, you are not far from lots of great restaurants. The rooms are spacious and all have a little kitchenette with dishes, fridge, microwave, and even a dishwasher! The bed was reasonably comfortable and the bathroom spacious. Customer service at the hotel was great - the staff really made me feel welcome. There is coffee/ tea available 24 hours, they have Monday night movies with free popcorn in a room off the main lobby, they have Manager's receptions a few nights a week with free drinks and snacks, and the breakfast is great! I found this hotel really paid attention to details. My TV remote wouldn't work and they replaced it right away. The hairdryer in my room also had a detachable diffuser - if you have curly hair (like me), you would understand how excited I was to see this!When I booked the hotel, I was worried about the location as all of my meetings were in Central London. This was not a problem at all as the hotel is located right beside Stratford Tube and train station. The tube takes about 45-50 minutes to get to Central London but the best way is by Javelin train.

When I booked a hotel in Stratford I was booking for ease of travel but wasnt expecting any kind of luxury or much service, however I was very wrong. I stayed on the 10th floor in a lovely suite built with comfort in mind. It had everything I could have asked for without the need to ask however if the need arose I knew I would be greeted with fantastic customer service.The staff were very friendly, helpful and welcoming. The breakfast catered for every requirement and was great.If I was staying for longer then I would definately stay here again. It appeared that the hotel was well organised and managed. All in all it was great value for money and close to all other amenities. Highly recommended.",February 2013,5.0,3,Traveled on business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Who goes to the east end for anything.  What a surprise.  The hotel was brand new..right across from Olympic Park.  The staff...unbelievable...absolutely incredible.  They went out of their way to make me feel right at home.   When I I had to travel for business they looked after my room to make sure everything was alright.  They greeted me with open arms when I came back.  This was better than anything I could expect.   So after 7 months has anything changed?  Absolutely not!!!!  The original owner John asks after me all the time.  Wayne the GM is always there when we need something.  Rafael always has his hand out to shake yours and asks if everything is OK...do we need anything, are we happy.  Tim, Nicolas, Hamad, Helen Sofie, Chris,  Deb, Mary, Mathias, Jason, Paul, Roy have made me a part of the family and look after me as one of their own. Some folks have left for new opportunities which is a bit sad because you become friends but the ambience, the attention to detail and prompt response when something needs to be fixed has and still remains fantastic. Anyone looking to travel to London needs to seriously consider this hotel.  You are in the middle of the Westfield Mall.  In 5 minutes you can be on the tube and into central London in 20 minutes.  You have the taxis if you need but the underground is still the most efficient way to travel.   This place is a real gem!!!

Out of the Tube station, up one level, then down the Street...and the hotel is right there.This is a lovely place to stay.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Chris_Marburg,Very Strange upgrade policy,"Basically the place is ok, set in the shopping centre. We stayed one night because of the proximity to London City Airport via DLR. My main critique is the upgrade policy. As a Priority Club Platinum RA I booked a standard studio with points 2 months prior to our visit, based on the positive remarks at trip advisor. When I checked my booking online I saw that it had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite. At that time I was thinking of canceling my reservation because I read the Olympic Park was closed and I was not really out for shopping and other options were also possible for a reasonable price for instance the very decent Hilton Canary Wharf were I would have had guaranteed club access. In the end I opted for the staybridge suites, because I liked the idea of a big suite and a kitchen. When I arrived at the place rather tired out after traveling, the person at the reception said I had been upgraded and that was fine for me. When I got to my room at the end of a mile long corridor I noticed it was a pretty small studio. My girlfriend was happy to have a bed so I did not complain, because it was only for one night. However I still think that it is rather strange to modify the reservation and offer a decent suite and then when you arrive at the place you get some box. This has up till now never happened to me with IHG, I mostly stay in IC Hotels and had very positive experiences in the past. If I had known that I get no or a marginal upgrade I would have chosen another hotel, especially because the place was not as excellent as I had hoped. You could hear the wind outside, bathroom small and boxy no electric kettle, so I had to boil up water for tea in a pan... Honestly after my experience I would not come back and am currently thinking of canceling my upcoming reservation for Staybridge Suites Time Square, because the benefits of a suite hotel a quite marginal if you a put into a small studio...",January 2013,2.0,44,Traveled as a couple,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,jeremyshearmur,Remarkable value for London,"Staybridge suites in Stratford is excellent:  it is clean, modern, and with very friendly and helpful staff.  What is on offer is much less spacious than, say, in Staybridge Suites in the US (just one chair in the corner of a bedroom, rather than a separate room for relaxing), but the kitchen facilities are good, as is the breakfast.A key feature of this is location: Stratford has first-rate travel facilities, and one is only a short walk from them.  The property is just by a large shopping mall, which has good supplies for catering for oneself (Marks and Spencer and Waitrose are both close and first rate); there is also a wide range of reasonably priced restaurants, and a cinema.A few small points.  The hotel offers low grade wifi; I paid for their enhanced service, but it was not all that reliable, and I'd recommend getting a backup 'dongle' (e.g. from Vodafone in the mall) if you need to be sure of some form of internet connection - although when the hotel service was working, it was better.  The hotel provides three free washing machines and driers - they are good, but not nearly enough: even when the hotel was fairly empty, it was a matter of real luck to get a machine when one was needed; beware, also, that they also have very long wash and dry cycles.  Third, the prices for outgoing phone calls are crazy - e.g. four pounds a minute to the US; six to Australia - if you wish to make calls, I'd strongly recommend purchase of a cheap phone and buying pay-as-you go minutes (there are, again, several phone companies in the mall; I personally ordered a cheap Vodafone from Amazon.co.uk to be delivered before I arrived).  Finally, found the room much too hot, and it took a while to get the heating switched off.All told, though, this is a first-rate place, and if I come back on business, it is somewhere that I will certainly return to.",January 2013,5.0,94,Traveled on business,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The hotel is located next to the Olympic Park and in the largest Shopping Mall in Europe, Westfield Stratford.  I paid in advance, through the hotel's site, £ 648 for a King bed studio for 7 nights from 26/12/2012 to 2/1/2013 ( I want to note that there aren't twin rooms ).  Although I asked a studio overlooking the Olympic Park, I finally had one overlooking the Mall. However the view was just as good and the most important was, because I am a light sleeper, did not bother me any noise from across Cazino.  The room was very clean, tidy with free wi-fi. There are two TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The kitchen is very convenient if you want to make or heat something     (it would be useful to exist instructions for the microwave, as there are for the dishwasher).  The breakfast was adequate, nothing special. I did not like that there were jam & honey jars that everyone got on the table and used his knife or spoon to eat through them.   The staff was very friendly, helpful and always with a smile.  The area is covered by 2 Tube lines (Central & Jubilee), overground, DLR, Southeastern high speed train which terminates in St. Pancras International station (which was very helpful when I arrived on 26/12 due to the Tube strike) and many bus lines ( 25 bus terminates in Oxford Circus).  Inside the Mall you can find many restaurants, we tasted ""the Jamie's Italian"" (Jamie's Oliver restaurant) and ""the Real Greek"" on the ground floor coming out from the hotel on the left. Also in the lower ground floor there are several fast food, better in my opinion ""Olive oil & Oregano"".

Our family of four stayed in 2 adjoining rooms for 6 nights over New Years.  Most London hotels can be a bit cramped and the Staybridge offers modern conveniences, a superb location adjacent to the new Westfield shopping center with plenty of restaurants, and convenient Underground service to downtown London (20 min) or St Pancras Int'l train station (7 min).  The bathrooms are elegant and modern, beds comfortable with fantastic views of Olympic park (which I recommend the walking tour from Bromley by Bow tube station at 11a everyday, even though you wont be able to tour the stadium as it is under construction for permanent use). The breakfast buffet was excellent with lots of fresh fruit, pastries and hot entrees.  The manager's reception on Tue and Wed offers light snacks and refreshments.  After a long day touring London it is quite relaxing to unwind at the Staybridge and the restaurants in the mall are excellent (just forget that you're in a mall).  We ate at Wagamamas and L'Agunitas (great) and Pizza Deluxe (not recommended).  We used underground service everyday via the Oyster Card (unlimited travel, kids free) which also goes to/from Heathrow with one only one transfer (1 hour 20 min) and 20 min to Waterloo.  If you cab from Heathrow you will be charged well over 100 pounds. All of the employees at Staybridge were friendly.   I remember one gentleman Timothy who checked us in who was quite courteous.

However, with some slight disappointments.Airport transfer:Stansted: Take Terravision at the airport, (booth 12), do book prior to departure to avoid getting caught in the long queues at the station. Book a later timing online, but no worries, you will be able to take the earlier ones if you arrive earlier. Cost of booking online is $6 pounds.Heathrow: It is really difficult getting from the hotel to Heathrow airport. Booked with National express but was greatly disappointed. Ultimately took a London cab to the airport, that cost us a total of $100 pounds. Rooms: Beautiful room with a full set of kitchen facilities including microwave, dishwasher and everything. Great Apple TV, and also wifi connection.Location: Staying at Stratford means that you will be able to get to pretty much everywhere just by taking the underground which is right next to the apartment. However, as it is based right next to the shopping mall, the nearest road is at the bus stop which is at least a 10 min walk to the hotel. May be a little of a challenge with luggages. Of course, the mall right next to the hotel is one of the biggest in London with Primark, Marks and Spencer and pretty much everything else. Shops open daily at 9am to 6pm from Mon - Sat. This means you can pretty much shop every day when you wake up!Disappointments: However, maybe it was the holiday seasons that the fact that they are shorthanded.

I have celiac disease and I'm used to having to ask for gluten free bread. Most hotels cater for this, I have to wait a bit longer, but that's ok. However, be aware that Staybrigde suites does not offer gluten free breakfast. The solution for me was that I had to buy my own bread and toast it in the rooms. So, if anyone working at the hotel reads this: Buy a gluten free frozen toast bread. When someone asks for gluten free bread, take a few slices, put them on a clean bakingtray and warm them for a few minutes in the oven.

My husband found the Staybridge Suites on line. It was newly built for the Olympics (summer 2012). Not only is everything pristine, the showers great, fully appointed kitchen, rooms spacious and a full and tasty breakfast included every day (and with as pricey as everything is in London, you will certainly appreciate that treat!), we were able to get two adjoining rooms for less than it would have cost us for one closer into the city! The staff is so helpful and friendly too. Most especially, if you go there look for Timothy ...he goes over and above, and gave us wonderful advice on many matters (transportation, things to do)! On Christmas, when everything is closed, he invited us to watch movies , popped popcorn , made nachos and served wine and beer to celebrate! (Chloe, another staffer, was also kind and helpful). My kids were sad to bid farewell to Timothy when he left for his days off before we left!The one negative of the Staybridge is that it is relatively far compared to other hotels. It was about a 20-40 minute tube (subway) ride once you got to the station (the central line station is a short 5 minute walk from the hotel). It is attached to a huge mall that has tons of stores and food options though. For perspective, some of the tour companies pick up at various hotels, but this one is far outside that range.All in all though, we felt the many fabulous things about this hotel (Timothy and the great service, the beautiful and spacious rooms, and the free breakfast) greatly outweighed the negative of the distance which we got used to.

Although technically located in East London, the hotel is extremely accessible to many parts of London via a short ride on the Tube, Overground, DLR, Bus and/or Javelin, plus it is part of the Westfield Stratford City complex, supposedly the largest retail centre in Europe, which provides an endless choice of shops and restaurants during one's stay.What really sets this place apart from countless other places we've stayed is the staff, who went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable, comfortable and worry-free as possible.  They never complained about any request and never tried to point out somehow that they were going out of their way or taking extra steps.  They just did everything possible for us as though it was the most natural thing in the world for them.  Special mention goes to Timothy, Sofie and Chloe at the front desk, and Debbie in the breakfast lounge.The one negative of the hotel is that it is not very convenient to arrive at and depart from with luggage.  It doesn't have a driveway like most hotels, and so when you first arrive it's necessary to get dropped off in the Westfield car park (underneath the Casino) or on the road next to the ""Chestnut Plaza"" restaurant area and then go find someone at the hotel to help transport your luggage to the hotel.  Indeed, we departed the hotel on Boxing Day, and there was such a huge cue of cars coming into Westfield for the sales that it wasn't even possible for a mini cab to drive to the Chestnut Plaza area.  And so Timothy (again without the slightest complaint) moved our luggage through the ""Street"" area of Westfield and over a footbridge to the Stratford Tube and Bus station in pouring rain so that we could meet our mini cab there.  All told, these difficulties with luggage end up being a very minor inconvenience compared to all of the positives of the hotel.Very highly recommended!",December 2012,5.0,25,Traveled with family,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

It is a short walk from the railway/tube station, followed by a quick ascension, in a fast lift, to the 12th floor, where charming and helpful receptionist are waiting to assist you.  We were checked in by Sophie, and later met Timothy (when I requested a room change)  Nothing was too much trouble for either of them.  The rooms are excellent, with everything one could need - I would like a slightly softer mattress (or perhaps a 'topper' on the mattress) also a choice of softer pillows,but that is all a personal preference.  Microwave, hob, dishwasher, fridge and sink, which is handy if one wants to stay in and cater for oneself.The breakfast was a 'help yourself to everything' and was more than adequate.  Hot and cold choices, with good juices, fresh fruits and a small selection of hot food.  Unfortunately we missed the evening nibbles with wine or beer on the Tuesday night (too busy shopping)If you need to stay in this part of London I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.",December 2012,5.0,22,Traveled with family,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

Strangely you don't seem to be able to from the car park to the hotel with out going outside, it's literally 50 feet, but these days it seems odd to have to carry bags outside from the underground car park and back inside . Shoppers would be surprised if they had to park and go outside to get to a mall that right above their heads. There is no end to the choice of places to eat and at every level from quick and cheap to expensive and formal, the quality  of all food outlets is very good and of course there is the shopping.

The room was clean and if we would have been staying longer the kitchenette would have come in very handy. The staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast had a good variety.

This not-so-secret residence is my future  choice for any possible alternative to the regular hotel fodder that you find on the usual internet travel sites.  Why haven't I been aware of this particular brand before?  I even lived in the US for two years without rumbling the delights and practicality of ""Suite"" living.OK, so you get my point, not well known, but just in a class of its own.  The Westfield Shopping 'mall' is incredible too, built as part the regeneration of the East of London as a legacy of the 2012 Olympics, so take empty suitcases so you can shop till you drop.  Superdry JPN, David & Goliath and Jack Wills were targets for my daughter, so you won't be disappointed if you follow fashion.Back to the hotel, sorry Suites, the reception (and lounge & dining areas) are on the 12th floor (on top of the world) and what a view of the city! Imagine this as you digest your complimentary breakfast, a panoramic vista; dramatic winter sunbeams cracking through the atmospheric cloud base, silhouetting the towering iconic Cityscape in a moment that will stay with you, at least until you finish your bagel...!

Upgraded to one bedroom suite due to hubby's priority card, which was a nice surprise. all staff we encoutered were very pleasant and polite.  On arrival in our room, we found the kettle was missing.  a call to reception and one was delivered within 5 minutes.very spacious suite.  spotlessly clean with very comfy bed.breakfast was very good with plenty of choices and although busy, not too chaotic.  Nice bright lounge areas.  One downside here is that it would be nice to be able to buy a good coffee in this area.  you could do as we did and bring one back from a cafe across the plaza.we went to Pizza Express and the cinema in the Westfield complex first evening.  Nice just to walk out of hotel and go around the corner for this.Saturday - easy access to Stratford Station and a short journey into the city on the Central Line.  Lord Mayor's Show in the morning, West End show in the afternoon.  By the time we got back to Stratford, we decided to get some food from M@S at Westfield and cook this in the kitchenette of our room, with a bottle of wine.  Excellent facilities in kitchenette, complete with dishwasher, so if you are feeling lazy, you dont even have to wash up!Sunday morning - hubby made use of the gym, while I took advantage of free newspaper and leisurely breakfast.  After breakfast, we did a trip on the DLR to Greenwich.  A walk around the Cutty Sark and the Naval College in the sunshine, nice lunch and then river boat to the O2.  Back on the Jubilee line to Stratford for a bit of retail therapy before driving home.  And only £10 for the car park from Friday to Sunday!!  Would therefore recommend Staybridge Suites for a weekend break.  Ideal location for so many activities and very good for couples or families.The only downside we experienced was the noise from the shopping complex between 04:00 and 06:00 on the Sunday morning, which woke us on 3 occaisions.  On talking to the Reception staff, who were very apologetic, it appears the Westfield shopping centre test their alarm and warning systems without due regard to hotel guests.  The Receptionist stated they had complained previously to Westfield about this.  We would definitely not let this put us off staying at Staybridge Suites again, but would recommend requesting a room overlooking the Olympic park, as you would not be likely to hear it there.",November 2012,5.0,156,Traveled as a couple,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

I had to move pots myself to find a table (the table next to us wasnt cleaned for 30 mins) and it took them 20 mins to bring me some pepper (had to ask as couldnt find any).  When I raised these issues with reception, they advised me that they were short staffed.  This is bad enough on a Sunday morning.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Sorry for the typos...,Really nice place to stay,"Stayed here from Friday to Sunday. The location of the hotel was brilliant, right next to westfield shopping centre which includes lots of restaurants too (literally about 30 steps...i think other customers may have been using the wrong door from the shopping centre to get here) and right by the tube (which you get to from shopping centre). When we checked in the staff were really pleasant, friendly and efficient. We were told there was no automatic turn down service on the weekend however they would do this for no extra charge if we asked for it (we didn't ask for this). I saw staff doing rooms during our stay so this clearly wasnt an issue if people required it. The room was fantastic. It was clean and nicely laid out. There was a little kitchen as you walk in the door (it didn't feel as though it was actually in your bedroom) which although we didn't cook while there was handy for the fridge and tap for drinking water. The bed was really comfortable and the tv (apple tv) was great. I always like cereal for breakfast and was really happy with the cereal choice here (they even had coco pops!). My partner likes to have a cooked breakfast when we go away and really liked the bacon and hash browns on the Saturday morning of our stay and said it was one of the best cooked breakfasts he'd ever had. The only negative thing to say about the hotel is that unfortunately on the Sunday the only cooked breakfast choice was sausage scrambled egg and beans (which he doesn't like). I guess they change the hot breakfast items each day. Thinking there was no harm in asking, there was a staff member in the area so he asked her if there was any chance of hash browns or bacon and she snapped ""that is all you are getting today"". Just seemed a little unnecessary. I had never stayed at a staybridge suite hotel before and feel like I have been missing out. It's a lovely atmosphere and the staff can't do enough for you (with the small exception at breakfast).

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Grindlehop,Few Niggles but very good,"Stayed here while working in Ilford, excellent location in the Westfield shopping centre and Olympic park, next to the main Stratford station with overland and tube links to the city of London.  First niggle is its not exactly easy to find, after leaving the station and approaching the shopping mall you can see the Holiday Inn sign but there are not further signs once you are inside the complex, I ended up having to ask at the information desk to be told I had to go upstairs then back out of the complex and round to the right past Mini shop and entrance was on the left.  Once in the entrance its all to easy to take the lift to the 6th floor reception to find you are in the Holiday Inn, the lifts to the right of the entrance lobby take you to the 12th floor Staybridge reception!  Check in was very efficient, upgrade to suite with bath and shower overlooking the shopping mall and casino, small living room with kitchen, fridge, dishwasher and microwave all very clean.  Bedroom separate from living area with comfortable double bed. Bathroom had large bath with rain forest type shower over it and bottles of shampoo and body wash, towels were lovely and fluffy.  Second niggle is the rooms that overlook the shopping mall can be quite noisy, there is only basic double glazing on these windows and music from the mall and casino goes on until around midnight, these windows should be triple glazed, not sure how quiet it was on the other side of the hotel but I assume the room overlooking the Olympic park would be a lot quieter.  The shopping complex has over 250 shops and an excellent M&S if you want to pick up a few things to eat in but it also has a vast array of restaurants and coffee shops.Arrived for breakfast around 7am, very quiet with plenty seating.  Breakfast spread was very good, hot selection of omelettes, scrabbled eggs, beans, sausage.  Pastry selection with croissants, muffins, bagels, loads of cereals fresh orange juice and a proper coffee machine grinding the beans as required.  Selection was not restricted to small packets either but full sized cereal boxes and large bottles of fresh orange juice.  Fantastic views over the Olympic park from the breakfast room.Check out was again efficient and everything in order.  I would have no hesitation in staying here again, staff were pleasant and room was exceptionally laid out and clean, but I would request a room on the Olympic park side to avoid the noise from the mall.",October 2012,4.0,55,Traveled on business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,SCAN60,Good value. Modern. Spacious. Comfortable. Excellent!,"Two of us stayed here in October 2012 for a week, in two separate rooms.  I was acknowledged as a Priority Club Platinum member on check-in and was given a complimentary upgrade to a one-bedroom suite on the 12th Floor.  My companion had the standard studio suite as booked.The hotel is situated a little distance away from Central London, adjacent to what was the main venue for the 2012 Olympics at Stratford.  I did not consider this non-central location to be in any way detrimental; it is close to the main Stratford transport interchange and is served by very frequent services on the Underground, Overground, Docklands and National Rail services.  It takes only about 7 minutes from Liverpool Street station, and is connected directly to the West End by Underground.  It is also close to the alternate Stratford International station which is served by High Speed services from St. Pancras (again, about 7 minutes) and various towns in Kent.  Visitors arriving by Eurostar can change at Ebbsfleet or Ashford, or can, of course re-trace their steps from St. Pancras.The hotel's entrance is directly on part of the huge Westfield shopping centre, which offers a very comprehensive range of retail and dining choices.  So, unless one has other reasons to do so, it's quite unnecessary to travel into London “proper” for, say, an evening meal.  I suspect that value is probably better here, too.  As I travelled by train, I can't comment on options for parking at or near the hotel.The hotel shares its building and mall entrance with a more conventional Holiday Inn.  Different lifts serve the two hotels, each of which has its own separate reception.  The Staybridge occupies the higher floors, with its reception area unusually on the top (12th) floor.  As well as some rooms and suites, this floor also has the breakfast room, lounge, an external balcony and is the venue for the evening reception (of which more later).The Staybridge appears to fall somewhere in between the concept of a conventional hotel, and that of serviced apartments.  That's not a criticism;  because of its suite style, the rooms are far more spacious than is typical for hotels in much of the UK and in London particularly.  Yet the important aspects of a more standard hotel are also present. The one-bedroom suite I used was superb with plenty of space in all three areas – the lounge/kitchen with its own TV and sofa, coffee table, desk etc., the bedroom with another TV, and the full sized en-suite bathroom.  The studio suite used by my companion was smaller of course, but still of sufficient size to prevent the feelings of claustrophobia often experienced elsewhere.  The studio room's ensuite has a walk-in shower, but no bath.There are no teams of smartly-dressed bellhops hovering around, but reception is manned 24 hours a day.  Rooms are equipped with fully functioning kitchen areas with kettle, microwave, hob, dishwasher, fridge, toaster, extractor fan and more than enough cutlery, crockery and utensils to make an extended stay here (as a home from home) quite practical.  There is also a guest laundry for (complimentary) use by guests. and a small gym with a small selection of modern equipment in good order, again free for guests' use.  There is no swimming pool.The rooms themselves have other useful offerings; the TV system, as well as the standard set of digital TV stations, offers an in-house streamed TV system (Apple TV) with movies and other extras – these are a chargeable service.  There is complimentary WiFi throughout.  As an option, guests can subscribe to a faster WiFi service, and doing so also includes the aforementioned enhanced TV provision.  Iron and board, hairdryer, tea and coffee ingredients and a safe were all present and correct, as were supplies of toiletries and towels etc., in the bathroomThe room was spotless and modern, but without appearing austere.  The hotel is fairly new so that is probably to be expected.  Normal hotel-style housekeeping is done daily except on Sundays when this service is only on request (at no extra charge).  The 5ft bed was very, very comfortable, and soundproofing appeared to be excellent.  I had seven very comfortable and undisturbed nights' sleep.  Air conditioning was effective and virtually silent.As is practice with Staybridge properties, there is a complimentary breakfast available daily and I have to say, I was quite pleasantly surprised at what was on offer.  Alongside a reasonable selection of breads and pastries were fresh fruit, dairy products, cereals and a good assortment of hot and cold drinks. And there were at least four hot items - scrambled egg or omelettes, baked beans or tomatoes, bacon or sausages, and hash browns available in various combinations daily.  If I had to criticise, then, as is often the case with hot buffets, the hot food wasn't always as hot as I would have liked.  As a complimentary service though, I thought this compared very well to some very over-priced alternatives in other establishments I have used recently, and the saving over eating in a paid hotel restaurant or, indeed, outside, can have quite a substantial impact on total costs of the stay, especially for a couple or larger group.For one hour only in the early evening, on three days per week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) they hold a “reception” in the same room.  This is free to guests; on offer are various snacks and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  It's a nice opportunity to meet other guests, or simply to have a free beer or two!  A nice touch.At other times, the same area has tea and coffee facilities and ingredients, and a fridge with soft drinks, fruit juices and milk, and guests may help themselves to anything they want.  Guests who have other needs, varying from washing powder to microwave dinners, ice-cream, sweets and so on, may purchase these from an area by reception.  All in all, this is an excellent enhanced level of service and provision. Reception staff, the breakfast staff, and the management team who greeted us at the evening reception, were all exceptionally friendly and hospitable.  At an average cost for the overall stay of GBP120 per night (weekends are cheaper than weekdays)(advance non-cancel rate, including VAT) I thought this hotel, for London, was exceptional value, particularly when one considers what is included (or “free”).  I think there are many other chains who need to take note.In summary – for its area, it's an unusually spacious yet very good value place to stay, just outside of, yet very convenient for, London.  In particular, the extra “free” services offered to guests can have a big impact on total trip expenditure.  The property is in very good order and is very very comfortable.  It would serve equally well, I think, for a short stay or as a place to live for a longer period.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and have no hesitation in recommending it.

I booked and prepayed the stay looking for value, and liking the tripadvisor reviews.  The room was clean and larger than many other London hotels.  Housekeeping did not come on many days.  I believe they came about 4/8 days, and not the last two.  The towels dried quickly enough, but there were not extras.  The bed was made when housekeeping came, but sheets not changed in the 8 days.  To me, the overall housekeeping was substandard.I thought the breakfast was fine; my wife did not like the quality of the food; her feeling was the same as another recent reviewer.  However, there was yogurt, a variety of juices and milk, eggs (even I agree they weren't great), some form of meat, a variety of cereals and rolls.  I avoided the hot foods.  However, unless you are somewhat demanding, I thought that the breakfast was not bad.  The staff was quite friendly, but not really a concierge service.  They were not generally very familiar with restaurants in the area, but they certainly tried to be helpful.  We felt very safe.  I paid about 1200 pound/$1800 for advance payment for the 8 nights in Stratford.  I thought it was a fair value, but quite a good value if the housekeeping had been better.  I did not think Stratford was that far out of downtown London.  About 25 mins/8-12 subway stops, which was fine to me.  The shopping area was huge, but coming from the US, we weren't actually doing a lot of shopping.Overall, this was a fine stay.  We would probably stay there again.

Breakfast was a disgrace, quite obvious that it had been prepared by Holiday Inn downstairs and delivered to staybridge at 0630, It's not hot not even warm, the eggs were awful, bacon tasted just of pure salt, and hash browns no taste at all, the cold options (excluding the cooked cold breakfast!!) were fortunately of a good standard. The room itself had a small kitchen area, no oven except a microwave, and only 2 rings. Okay this was fine for a 2 night stay, but definitely not for long term use, impossible to cook anything except fried foods or microwave meals really, no washing machine in the room but a laundry room is on site if you don’t mind washing your laundry in public!!

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Theologyprof,Good venue for shopping,"If it's shops you're after, you could hardly do better than this - it's right at the heart of the Westfield in Stratford, which is evidently the biggest shopping center in Europe.  It's also reasonably convenient for central London - 20 minutes by tube from Westminster, though I think it's a bit more than the 200 yards from Stratford station that they claim in their publicity.  And when you get to the Westfield, it's easy to miss it first time as the only signs at ground level are transparent images on a glass frontage.Inside, it's bright and new, though you have to go up to level 12 for reception and then back down again for your accommodations.  The kitchen was well equipped and the furnishings comfortable, with a bath tub that's actually big enough to stretch out in.  The whole place is built around the marketing concept that this is your 'home' for your stay, and that is reflected in the way breakfast is made available - a little chaotic the way the different tables with food are laid out, and with staff more obsessed with clearing up than doing much in the way of help or service (I left my table momentarily to get a coffee and by the time I returned all the rest of my food had been cleared away, which meant I had to start again).  Overall the staff (reception especially) are pleasantly friendly, though the nightly manager's reception was an embarrassing experience - it's billed as free drinks etc to unwind and get to know the other guests, most of whom (predictably) aren't really interested in this sort of artificial conversation and are only there for the drinks (which were fine).Overall then, good accommodations, but I'm not sure that the 'homely' ethos really works in any different a way than a regular hotel.",October 2012,4.0,302,Traveled on business,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

The concept is all American too, with big rooms with a kitchenette and no hotel restaurant or bar but food and drink to buy at reception.  Therefore it’s not the place for a posh dinner, but for a great room at a great price and whatever you choose to eat, it’s a really good deal.  Room service food IS available 24/7 though.I should mention that the hotel is about 50 yards from the food court at Stratford City - Westfield, so you have great food from all around the Globe right on your doorstep.  Why should they bother with a restaurant in the hotel ?!Being next to Westfield is a big plus and the hotel is less than 100 yards walk from Stratford station which has so many connections into London I couldn't list them. Suffice it to say that it is three stops and 10 minutes into Liverpool Street in the City so it’s very convenient.Add to that a towering location with views over the Olympic Park, Canary Wharf and most of London, then the location is pretty amazing.

Originally I was looking for somewhere closer to the centre of London, but with prices still inflated after the Olympics, Staybridge proved to be excellent value. We had asked for a room with a view, and they didn't disappoint, our room looked directly over the Olympic stadium and swimming arena.Coming from Stanstead airport we got directly to the hotel via a train from the airport, and three stops on the central line from Liverpool Street Station. A couple of minutes walk and we were there.  The close proximity of the tube meant we could be in central London in half an hour, so despite not being in the centre we found it most convenient.Our room was well appointed with a small kitchen and a most comfortable bed. Everything was very clean and well looked after.

The staff member was very welcome and genuine and I have never received such a warm welcome from any other hotel. He also remembered my name at check-out which was a nice touch. Location-wise this hotel is smack bang in the middle of Westfield shopping centre which was very convenient as we visited the casino there during out stay, which is directly opposite the hotel.This is a fantastic hotel and I hope I get the chance to stay here again!",October 2012,5.0,4,Traveled as a couple,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,mkjan13,Choose this hotel you can't go wrong + fab views = bonus!,"First impressions; smart, state of the art hotel on the outer edge of the fabulous Westfield shopping centre, sandwiched between top end retail stores Liberty and Mulberry.  Friendly and efficient staff on reception.We were going to the o2 to watch a Cirque du Soleil performance, so convenient only a 200 yard walk to the tube station then a couple of stops on the Jubilee line takes you straight there (get off at North Greenwich tube station which is right at the o2).  I have never stayed in an aparthotel before so we decided to try out the kitchen facilities and eat in, there's Waitrose and M&S nearby to buy some nice food and wine.  There are of course plenty of eateries in the shopping centre and there's also a room service menu at the Staybridge.  The microwave was perfectly adequate though you might struggle if you need to warm up a big pizza as you don't get a conventional oven.  Also we were missing a kettle - so had to boil up mugs of water in the microwave for a cup of tea.  I enquired the next day when I checked out - apparently some rooms had their kettles removed for descaling and clearly not replaced!  Everything is modern and new with most things provided; tea/coffee/milk/sugar/salt, dishwasher tablet, washing up liquid, paper kitchen towels (though no tea towel to dry any washing up).   Also tissues, body wash, shampoo, conditioner is provided in the bathroom.  There's a good sized safe to stow a laptop.The best bit - the view and watching the glorious sunset!   We had a panoramic view of the London skyline including the o2, Danary Wharf, Gerkin, Shard, post office tower with the Olympic Stadium in the foreground.  We were in room 1102 which we were warned was under the gym but there was absolutely no noise. It was a room for the disabled so there was a wetroom shower rather than a bath (not sure if this is standard throughout).  The Suites are from floors 8 to 12 so the views are all great.  I think Holiday Inn take the lower floors and views over the other side towards the shopping centre.Excellent sleep quality, 2 pillows each as standard and very comfortable mattress.The breakfast exceeded expectations, I thought it would be a simple continental breakfast but there was a hot counter with sausage, hash browns, scrambled egg and tomato as well as the usual cereal, toast and croissants plus a huge fridge filled with cartons of fruit juices and milk.  Check in is from 3pm and check out at 12 noon.  We stayed on a Saturday night and just wished the Westfield shops opened earlier than 12 noon on the Sunday as we didn't have time to hang around, but great if you want a lie-in and don't need to rush off anywhere!  I'm tempted to book in again just to do my Christmas shopping! Choose this hotel you can't go wrong.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,BritTraveller68,OK Accommodation at Sensible Rates,"Hotels in the centre of London are getting greedy and it's increasingly difficult to find rooms that are within budget.So a couple of weeks ago, I cast my net out further and stayed here.This was probably the shortest time I've spent at any hotel, as I arrived late in the evening and had to depart soon after breakfast.I did struggle to find the hotel, not helped by my late arrival, the fact it was already dark, the shopping centre closing and the lack of signage to it.  The nearby Premier Inn seems to have taken all the signage space for itself.  With the clear light of day the next morning, it was clear that it wasn't too tricky to find when you could see your way. It is marked on the key to this map.http://uk.westfield.com/stratfordcity/images/pdf/wsc-mall-guide-oct09-12-lo-res.pdfI did try to call for directions, but the phone wasn't answered. Later, when I did check in, the reception phone started to ring again and the lady who was looking after me even told me that she wasn't going to answer it.  I chose not to tell her that that would have been me 30 minutes ago!I've stayed a few times at the excellent Staybridge Suites in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  The suites here in London are similar, but about one-third smaller.  I did get a Platinum member upgrade which gave me a bath as well as a shower.  I've always found the lighting systems in these suites confusing.  Having mastered the one in Newcastle, I didn't do as well here.The bed was comfortable, though I didn't sleep as well as expected, as the Westfield Shopping Centre doesn't seem to ""sleep"".  Throughout the night, I could hear the sounds of maintenance taking place and deliveries.  Next time, I would probably ask for a room overlooking the former Olympic Park.As it was late, I decided to select some things from the hotel's larder.  I was disappointed to find just one single item of frozen food in the cabinet, namely a twin-pack pizza.  All the other items were just snacks.  So that had to do.  I'm used to a much better stocked pantry in Newcastle.Breakfast as OK, though I was very disappointed to find the baked beans to be stone cold.  And the breakfast service had only started 15 minutes earlier.Check-out was fine and the young gentlemen very personable.I've decided to rate this hotel as ""average"".  If there was a 3.5 ""good"" rating, I would have scored it so.  But some of the shortcomings I've mentioned, when compared to the much better experience at the Staybridge Suites in Newcastle, mean I can't rate it a ""very good"".",September 2012,3.0,286,Traveled on business,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0
Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Grecophile,"LOVED It, a good experience & I'll definitely be back","Was in London for a couple of days and due to short notice and the amount of rooms I needed (7) I was struggling to find anywhere nearer the centre. Decided to bite the bullet and try the Staybridge having stayed in them in the States and Newcastle Upon Tyne in the past. It is a good tube ride away from the centre of London but literally only 40 mins and very straightforward. There is a bit of a lengthy walk once outside the tube, you have to walk up and across the the Westfield shopping centre and the hotel is situated at the far end. It shares the building with the Holiday Inn but you have your own lift and separate reception on the 8th floor.Check in was fairly simple, our rooms weren't ready as we were early but we left our luggage and headed into London again for the afternoon. Once we got back and got our keys we were all on the 7th floor. The King Suites were lovely a proper self contained apartment, kitchen with fridge and cooking facilities, large lounge with bed settee, and a large bedroom and bathroom. I had no view except of the roof of the shopping centre and most disappointing was the fact the windows wouldn't open at all, I hate hotels who do this as I like fresh air. The lounge and bedroom both had efficient air con but not suitable to sleep with it on. There's no bar in the Staybridge but they do occasionally put a managers evening on which includes free wine, beer and nibbles. There is a balcony with seats but don't think you'll be allowed to go out here and smoke !...........you have to descend the 8 floors in the lift and stand outside the entrance, not sure why.Breakfast is adequate all self service with a fair choice although the coffee machines are sooooo slow it takes an age and the queues can get very long. They absolutely adhere to the timings for brekki so if your 5 mins late forget it as everything is promptly cleared away bang on 10am.I'd definitely stay again, but would be better prepared and probably sort my own breakfast out and take my own drink for the apartment.",October 2012,5.0,"14,192",Traveled on business,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Want to shop? Its within just a few metres of the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford. Here on  business in the East End? Youre at the east end... going to Canary Wharf? So's the DLR train at Stratford station. Doing the London tourist thing? Well its just a short walk through the Westfield centre to the excellently connected Stratford station, providing overground, Dockland railway and the Central line. As with all megacities, whatever you're close to you're close to, but thats never much in comparison to what the city has to offer, so using the tube is an essential skill for any tourist tp London. Hence while you can pay big money to be next to parliament, or Convent gardens, or one of the many museums, or Lords, or Harrods, or Hyde Park, or... well you get the picture, you wont be aywhere near the rest. So why not stay here for less than half the price and use the tube to get to all you want to see?And what do you get for you much cheaper price? Well a huge amount actually. Your room is a suite, with a small fully equipped kitchen featuring a 2 ring hob, dishwasher, fridge, combi oven/microwave, kettle, toaster and all utensils. There's a large workdesk, sofa and a TV with the Apple box. The separate bedroom has a king bed and the ensuite a full size bath. The whole place is new and scrupulously clean. There are connecting rooms for larger families.The rate includes a complimentary breakfast which does mean its a little limited on hot and fruit choices, but this is still much better than a holiday inn express complimentary breakfast, and they're most satisfactory. The view from the breakfast room is wonderful, and for those wishing to challenge their vertigo theres a large outdoor balcony to enjoy.Staff are really friendly and a special mention  to Timothy who I can see is becoming a real legend on this thread. Yes, Tim, I will be back. Both for business and with the family. I am pretty certain that this is likely to become my new base for both business and pleasure in London.

First of all, I was impressesd by the location of the hotel. Upon arriving via the tube at the Stratford station, it was barely a 5 minutes walk through the modern shopping plaza of Westfield city with tonnes branded outlets, fastfood chains and restaurants. I knew it would be very convenient even before arriving at the reception.The reception itself was located at the highest level of the building which was unlike any typical hotel lobby. There was a homely feel to it with plenty of tables and comfortable chairs. From the lobby it was all about the breathtaking view of the Olympic stadium. 	The staff who greeted us was friendly enough. We did arrive around 1.30pm which was earlier than the 3pm check in time. We also requested for a room with the Olympic stadium view during our advance purchace via the official hotel website. Understandably, the room was not yet ready since we arrived early. 	We were told to get ourselves comfortable at the lobby and pantry with complimentary bevarages from the coffee machine. Our only regret was that we waited until past 3pm and we were told our room was still not ready. It was unfortunate to get an explanation that it would take a bit more time to try and get the room with the particular view requested. I almost felt that the fault was mine for putting in such request. After reinstating that the request was made more than a month in advance we were given 'another' room on a different floor with the olympic stadium view. It definitely wasn't a pleasant check in process.	Once we (finally) gotten into our room, a king size bed studio suite, everything was available just as mentioned in the previous reviews. The kitchen was a stand out with all its kitchenette and even an automated dishwasher. The apple tv was a good inclusion as well with its huge selection of international channels except the surprisimg lack of English sport channels. Those Barclays Premier League football fans may be slightly disappointed. Then we noticed the fridge wasn't working. The frontdesk was notified. There wasn't any other room of our type available. Subsequently, we were very grateful that they decided to upgrade us to a one bedroom suite.	Our four nights at the Staybridge has been a pleasant experience. With all the facilities available (even has a free laundry room complete with washing machine and dryer), I would say it has also been a good value overall.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,David F,Just the ticket!,"Stayed here recently for a weekend trip to London with my wife. Hotel is 2-3 mins from  the doorstep of Stratford station (Jubilee, Central and Overground). Central London is only 20 mins away on the tube (you'll need a Zone 1-3 travelcard). It is located within the brand new Westfield shopping centre which is huge and has loads of shops and restaurants. Hotel sits on the top five floors of the Holiday Inn Stratford and if you get a room on the even side, you have great views of the Olympic Park (although it is now closed until next July). Rooms are an okay size but very well decorated. You have a full kitchen with everything you need - microwave, fridge, toaster, oven, hob and even a dishwasher. Flat screen TV with AppleTV connected. Bathrooms don't have a bath but the rainfall shower is excellent. There is a complimentary breakfast served on the 12th floor each morning and as well all the usual continental breakfast items, they also serve hot items like sausage, egg, bacon, hash browns etc. There is also complimentary tea/coffee served here at any time. Although the internet is complimentary throughout the hotel, it is very low speed (256kbs) and is really only useful for web browsing. You can purchase high speed internet for £7 per 24 hrs which runs from the Apple TV in your room and gives you speeds of approx 8Mbs. This would be my only complaint about the hotel. I was there Ryder Cup weekend (bad timing, I know) so purchased the internet on the Friday afternoon and expected to have to renew it again for the Saturday evening, but it was still connected and was only charged £7 for the whole weekend. Not sure if this was an error or maybe you get it for the 2 days at weekends but I wasn't complaining. I also had a problem when checking out as someone else rather cheekily purchased a bottle of wine and put it onto our room, but the extremely pleasant american guy at reception immediately removed it with no hassles when I queried this with him. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London. Any staff that we encountered were very helpful and friendly and the location is excellent (if you don't mind 20 mins on the tube into London). For reference, I had a bit of trouble finding the hotel on first arrival as it is not signposted, so here are some easy directions if you do plan to visit there.When exiting Stratford station, you will see some escalators/stairs in front of you, go up these to the ground floor (station is on lower ground). You will see M&S on your left. Stay outside the shopping centre and walk round the corner to your right and then walk up towards the Nike and Liberty stores. When you get past Liberty go round the corner to your left and the entrance to the Holiday Inn and Staybridge Suites is on your left. Take one of the two lifts on the right hand side of the small lobby and go up to the 12th floor.",September 2012,5.0,39,Traveled as a couple,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

But also face the very large outside (smoking) area of the Casino opposite. Being a light sleeper the noise subsides at 4am. To be fair on checking out, the receptionist did say when I was asked if everything was OK that they do recognise the noise problem and views of these rooms.

Breakfast selection is superb, however the scrambled egg was powdered, but then again it would be difficult to stop it from drying out on a hotplate.

It's initially not easy to find - certainly not as easy as the directions on the website suggest. Best to go into the shopping mall, get yourself a map and find it on there. It's only a couple of minutes from Stratford station, once you know where you are going. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast has received mixed reviews, and I can understand that the basic buffet system won't be to everyone's liking, but it was fine for us. The only negative was that the tables were sometimes cleared away rather hastily - one day we went to get some hot breakfast, and returned to our table to find our remaining half glasses of fruit juice had been removed - I heard other guests having similar problems. Great to have the tables cleared efficiently, but only once the guests have actually finished please! Plenty of restaurants around, either adjacent to the main entrance, or in the shopping mall.

The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful throughout. I had a studio room - bedroom, bathroom and kitchen - with a great view of the Olympic Park. One of the real plus factors is that the hotel is very new so everything feels clean and fresh.While there is no room service or restaurant there are numerous restaurants in the Westfield centre and crockery and cutlery is provided in the kitchen if you wanted a snack in your room, or even to cook a meal. There is a supermarket in Westfield. On the 12th floor of the hotel is a fantastic patio/balcony with views over London and the Olympic Park, along with a lounge and a den with board games provided if needed.The hotel does serve breakfast in the lounge daily but this was the one drawback. The choice of a cooked breakfast was limited and I gave up on the scrambled eggs after day one as they tasted like powdered eggs. The croissants were also good some days and dry on others. And the coffee - from a machine - was awful. Practicaly undrinkable.I paid a premium rate during the Games but if you want a cheaper option to stay in London - but with bigger and more luxurious rooms than you would get for that price in central london - this is great.

Booked a studio and was upgraded to a one bedroom apartment. Excellent value for money (GBP90++ a night, incl breakfast). Location is alright, a bit hard for my taxi to find (your car need to go into carpark B, mine went to the wrong one), a bit out of the way but above a huge shopping mall with lots of restaurants and shops. Very good if you are using London City Airport.What makes it special apart from the price is the little extra here and there. Here are some examples: the staff are friendly and helpful, will go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay. Complementary breakfast, you can bring the tray from your apartment to the breakfast and take them back to your room. Free wifi, enough to check emails etc but if you need a faster connection, it will cost GBP7 per 24 hours which is cheap compare to other London hotels I stayed.A few negative points: my key card seems to have problem operating the lifts. Need to change the card 2 times before it works (Nicolai from reception has been extremely helpful). Fire alarm also went off on Monday morning twice, with no prior warning (just a couple of seconds each time). You cannot get from hotel to taxi without carrying your luggage through a flight of elevators and when you left the hotel building to the elevators, that area is uncovered (it was raining the day I left).",September 2012,5.0,110,Traveled solo,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

The comments prior to mine are right on target.  The entire staff here that we encountered were wonderful.  Beyond friendly and always helpful and made you feel right at home.  It is a bit hard to find once you exit the tube station and the first time we were hauling luggage as we came from the airport.  The mall that is attached has everything you need to include a grocery store.  We were tired of eating out one night and decided to get a small meal to make in the room but the prices for food in the grocery store are really no cheaper than eating out.  The rooms are super quiet which I loved.  But don't be fooled by a ""king suite"" for us Americans that means a king bed as well.... Not here the bed is a queen.  The bed and bedding were very comfortable.  The breakfast in the morning is a real plus and the views from there are spectacular.  My only complaint is that it is a bit out of the city proper and you really need to get on a tube to do anything.  Most rides averaged 20 to 30 minutes and little waiting at the stations.  It's good to buy a week long pass.  But it took almost an 1 1/2 hours to get here from the airport with two major switches.  A pain when hauling luggage but a taxi would cost well over $130 dollars.  Bottom line..must not mind riding the tube a lot to get around.  We are staying near the airport for our last night as we have an early flight and don't want to mess with the trains at 0300.Would stay here again for sure.",September 2012,5.0,126,Traveled as a couple,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

If you want your room cleaned during weekends you can ask for it 24 hours in advance, but it was absolutely no problem for me, got some extra towels and I can make my own bed... Kitchen is the big plus for the suites, complete with dishwasher. Bed very comfortable, really comfortable chair (seems a small detail, but I loved the big chair). The walk-inn shower also very good, did not miss the bath. And it's clean. So nothing to comment on the rooms and staff, very positive!The only downside is the area it's in, good transport but Central Line can be very busy. Shopping center is of course a great advantage (very good supermarket on the lower ground floor, Waitrose) but there were quite some construction works going on, starting at 7 in the morning, even on Sunday.

The suites are spot on and the kitchen gives you the option of grabbing something from M&S or Waitrose in the adjacent mall (approx 50m from the entrance) and eating in if youve had a long day. Alternatively there are lots of restaurants if youve still got the energy to pop out.The suites are positioned on the floors above the Holiday Inn so have much better views and they are super quiet, we hardly heard anything so a good nights sleep was had by all.Breakfast concept was very good and again the emphasis was ""making yourself at home"" good choice of cereals,pastries,fruit and hot items in a very relaxed atmosphere. We managed to get back one night in time for the Managers drinks getogether with some complimentary drinks and snacks plus a quick chat with the staff. Rooms with even numbers look out over the Olympic Park but odd numbers have decent views too and you can clearly see Alexandra Palace so no worries either way. This is a fantastic place to stay when in London, its ideal for tube and train but my tip is to buy tickets for the high speed train service from St Pancras, its a 6 minute journey, loads of seats and it is far more relaxing than the hustle and bustle of the much longer tube journey. Our return ticket cost just over £11 for 4 people so book online for a stress free journey too and from Staybridge.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and they even let me check in at 11am as I had arrived rather early. The rooms are brand new... it felt as though I was the very first person to have ever stayed in the suite.  The 1 bedroom unit was very spacious and has a very decent kitchenette and a decent sized fridge (bigger than your average bar sized fridge that you would usually get).  This was great as I had been travelling around Europe for 6 weeks prior and I was glad to be able to finally cook some decent wholesome food as I was rather over eating out for every meal.  The lounge on the top floor is awesome too, its open 24 hours a day and you can take your own food and drinks up to the lounge area and just relax.  This was great, I would invite friends over and we would have evening drinks up in the lounge.  Then when we wanted more privacy, we would just simply head down to my room and I would entertain in the lounge in my suite instead.  THIS is why the place feels like a home away from home.  The views are of the London skyline too which is fantastic... great at night too.There is also a free laundry with washing machine and dryer... the only downside is that you have to stay with your washing whilst it is drying as there is no 'timer', just a sensor that 'senses' when your clothes are dry... the sensors are terrible and they constantly stop even when your clothes aren't dry so you must stay there - but its free so its good!!  The location is fantastic as well!  Only about 10 mins by tube to Liverpool Street stop and it is amongst Westfield that was built for the Olympic games, its the biggest mall in Western Europe and its very VERY nice place to hang out, it has a movie theatre, plenty of places to eat and a tonne of shops... you can spend an entire day there without realising you have done so!  I only have one little negative to say ... the hotel does not do room cleaning on Saturday or Sunday!  So on the weekends you will have to make your own bed, and ring up to have fresh towels delivered and toilet paper etc.  A little slack and this is a concept I don't quite understand for a fantastic hotel like this.  A second negative is that when you do have staff come to your room, they never knock, they just open your door with their master key and walk on in... I really did get a major fright several times when this happened.  I think it would be courteous if they could knock and wait for a reply or for someone to answer the door.Other than that, this hotel is perfect and I highly recommend it!",August 2012,5.0,92,Traveled with friends,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Good selection of freeview channels (although not quite the full range) on large screen TVs - one in lounge and another in bedroom!  Free wifi although it is a little slow.  There are only two lifts which can mean a bit of a wait sometimes, especially as anyone checking in also needs to use them to get from the ground floor to reception.  Check out took a bit too long - mainly the fault of the guest 'in front' of me rather than the reception staff, but it did mean I missed my train.  Express checkout facility would be appreciated.  Once the Olympics are over I imagine there will be some good deals on offer and considering the good rail and tube links it may be worth thinking about this as an alternative to more expensive central London hotels.",August 2012,5.0,204,Traveled with friends,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Overall, the hotel was very good for the price and location, and I left the hotel feeling relaxed and impressed enough to stay again.GOOD POINTS: The welcome by the reception staff was professional and easy. The room (I stayed on the 8th floor) was very comfortable and had everything you would need for a short stay or longer as the mini kitchen was well equipped with utensils and appliances (dishwasher, microwave oven, kettle, fridge). The bed was exceptionally comfortable (Hypnos Beds) and the Samsung TV had a good range of channels, all with good picture/reception quality. The bathroom was not massive, but the shower was a good size with strong water pressure and a shower head that was height adjustable beyond 6ft. The view from the room overlooked the Olympic park and the city skyline, and on a clear day you could see for miles. There are numerous restaurants within minutes of the hotel and Stratford tube/rail is less than five minutes walk away. Despite the potential for a lot of noise in the immediate area, the rooms were very quiet.BAD POINTS: Only one, and that was the breakfast. The format of the breakfast is considerably more relaxed than most hotels, with the hotel trying to convince you are at home by using large jars of jams, full size cereal boxes and kitchen decoration that you might have at home. For me, this didn't quite work, as whilst the type of food available was okay, I'm not so sure about the hygiene aspects of many people using the same jar of jam or box of cereal. The coffee from the automatic machine was pretty rough, though the good selection of Twinnings tea made up for it.",August 2012,5.0,5,Traveled as a couple,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

I have to say, it's probably one of the most beautifully designed and finished hotels I've ever stayed in. The hotel room and the lobby and reception areas were all superbly lit with really close attention to detail paid to the colours and materials used throughout the whole complex. The room that I stayed in was like a large five-star studio flat, with a state of the art kitchenette, huge wet room shower, and ultra-modern fittings. If you appreciate good design and detail this hotel is non-stop eye candy.The staff were super friendly and accommodating. My only criticism is that I was so wow'd by the whole place that when it came to breakfast I was expecting something on a similar scale, but it was a bit more inline with other hotels I'd stayed at - which was fine - but given the size of the breakfast area I'd maybe got my hopes set a bit too high! I understand when I went the hotel had only been open a few weeks so perhaps this has changed.And lastly, the bed was so comfortable it made it pretty hard for me to actually get up and start my day - beware if you've got things to do the next day, it'll be difficult to leave this place behind.

Staybridge Suites London - Stratford City,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,THO_Finland,Nice hotel in a lively location,"I stayed at Staybridge Suites London-Stratford City for a weekend in mid-August. This was my first Staybridge experience and I have to say I really liked it!The hotel is located in East London, within the Westfield Stratford City complex. It's just a couple of minutes from the Stratford tube station (zone 3). Oxford Circus is about 18 minutes away on the tube's Central Line. First I was a bit concerned about the distance to Central London, but in practice it was a non-issue.Finding the hotel is a bit adventure because there is no Google Street View (nor a detailed Google Map) available of the area. Basically it goes like this:1) Exit the tube to the Westfield / Olympic Park side of the station.2) Go one level up to the Westfield outdoor plaza level (stairs, escalators and lifts are available).3) Walk about 150 yards along the shops and restaurants and pass The North Face and Timberland stores on the left. The hotel is in the same building as these stores.4) Turn left on the corner of the building and you have arrived to the hotel. Take the right hand side lifts to 12th floor for reception. (The left hand side lifts are for the Holiday Inn hotel.)The building is a brand new one and houses two hotels. The Staybridge Suites is located in floors 8 to 12. The reception and common areas are located at the top floor with the most of the rooms in floors 8–11. Rooms with even numbers have amazing views to the south(ish) and skyscrapers of Canary Wharf. The rooms with odd numbers face the Westfield with not so amazing views.I stayed in one bedroom suite which, by London standards, was huge. Everything was brand spanking new and spotlessly clean. The decor is modern and comfortable. I really liked the use of framed art photos and some glassware as decorations. The suite kitchen is very good with a stove, microwave/grill, fridge and dishwasher. All needed pots, plates and cooking accessories were also available.The lounge/breakfast room/den in the 12th floor is very comfortable. Coffee and tea are available 24h from there. There is also a very nice terrace with great views to the Olympic Park and London skyline.The staff was very friendly and accommodating during the stay.All in all it was a very nice stay.

It's literally 2 minutes walk from stratford station. Some reviews on here spoke of the hotel being hard to find. It's actually really easy. Coming out of stratford station you take the lifts or escalators outside up to the 1st floor and instead of entering Westfield you walk to the left along the outside part of the centre called ""The Street"". The hotel is on the left next to the Prada store.The reception, pantry and breakfast area is on the 12th floor giving fabulous views over the Olympic park with an outside terrace with a bbq.The welcome from the reception staff was fantastic and really friendly. All of the staff I encountered during my stay couldn't do enough for you.The room itself is absolutely fantastic with a huge bed and a fully equipped kitchen which is very useful as Waitrose supermarket is nearby in Westfield so makes it very convenient to cook your own food. Alternatively, if you don't want to cook there is a huge range of different restaurants in Westfield and also in the adjoining Holiday Inn. The room and bathroom were spotless and still had that ""new building"" smell. The shower was huge and very powerful. The room also had a large TV with digital channels and free wi-fi is available. For an extra charge you can upgrade to using the Apple TV and to a faster wi-fi connection.The breakfast is included in the room price and was very nice. It's a buffet in a room that is like your own kitchen from home. There was a large fridge with different juices that you can pour yourself and they had loads of different spreds in the jars that you can have with your toast. There was also a decent selection of hot items as well.Overall I couldn't recommend this hotel more. I had a fantastic stay and wished it could have been for longer.

I booked the night using loyalty points so had paid nothing but nevertheless was upgraded to a one bedroom suite. Timothy on reception was awesome; he could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. Debbie was the same- she took my daughter off to take pictures of the Olymopic stadium and made us feel so at home.The suite was lovely, if you were there for an extended trip it had everything you needed including a fridge, hob and microwave. Our only gripe was the bed was a little firm but we like squishy!Due to the upcoming Games the Staybridge gym was not in use but I was able to use the Holiday Inn gym which is attached.The evening reception, managed again by Debbie was by far the best complimentary reception we have had. It puts the Embassy Suites and Drury Inn ones to shame.The breakfast too was fine tho scaled down a little due to a piower cut.

Equally, the restaurant in the hotel boasts many delicious, inventive dishes coming out of the kitchen led by an attentive head chef.

Thanks!Comfy bed. Fabulous (and I mean fabulous) shower. And what a view!The view from the 12th floor (reception, breakfast etc) is the best of London I've ever seen. In the distance, the Telecom Tower*, Shard/Gherkin, Canary Wharf, Millennium Dome*, new cable car, and... hills! In the foreground, various train lines (with what look like little toy trains from the 12th floor) and all the activity of the Olympic Park.

With Waitrose & M&S close nice food can easily be bought to so can save money on eating out. Inside the room there was a stove, microwave and fridge so could easily cook to. Only complaint was couldn't find the instructions for the microwave so wasn't sure if we could heat it up to be an oven or not but if we were really concerned the reception could have helped but we decided to stick with stove and microwave foods. View was great over the Olympic park, we had paid extra for the view over the park but if I'm honest I don't believe it was a necessity as the view out of the reception and when you're eating breakfast was the best in the whole building so the extra money for the view out of the room I wouldn't personally pay for again.I'd definitely recommend the Staybridge Suites to anyone and after staying in the Newcastle one & now this one I'm looking forward to more opening up around the country.",June 2012,5.0,23,Traveled as a couple,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

So it’s great if you want to see the Olympics and also if you like retail therapy which can be carried out in the Westfield Stratford Shopping Centre next door. Stratford itself has excellent transport links such as Oxford Circus in about 20 mins on the central line. However, the stay was not without its negatives, the larder (this is a place where you purchase foodstuffs to cook and eat in your room) was poorly stocked, the fire alarm went off during the middle of the night and the team seemed a little disorganised.Said that, I’m sure that things will sort themselves out but when you pay over £200.00 for one night, you expect nothing to go wrong.",June 2012,3.0,33,Traveled on business,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

My daughter caught the 6 minute high speed train from St pancras and i drove to Tottenham Hale and caught the 10 min train straight in.  Was a lot cheaper then the £25-35 per day parking.  When you entre the building make sure you use the right hand side elevators as the ones on the left take you to the Holiday Inn that shares the building.  Check in/out and the staff were superb, very freindly and attentive.  The suite itself was very spacious and luxurios.  Lovely kitchenette with everything you need (including a dishwasher) , free tea and coffee although they also serve this free day and night in the residents lounge.  Big apple TV, relaxing chair and table and a huge very comfy bed.  The bathroom was really nice with a massive shower and very nice toiletries.  There is even a laundry basket in your room if you want to pop to the launderette down the hall.  You can purchase food from them or M & S or Waitrose that are next door to cook  or The Holiday inn have a restaurant serving food.  The free breakfast was great, all you can eat, hot and cold and the even provide takeaway bags if you want it in your room instead.  The views are stunning as they overlook the olympic park.

Whilst the hotel is a little out of the centre of the city, Stratford tube station is two minutes walk away, and the location near the Olympic park would obviously be perfect for the Olympics. Since the hotel is brand new, everything was spotless. We stayed in a Studio Suite which was pretty small but well laid out, with a small kitchen area that felt separate to the bedroom. The bathroom was great - huge shower and large bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, and plenty of towels. The bed was quite firm but really big and comfy. I really liked having the kitchen and the hotel really does feel like a home away from home. Breakfast was laid back - no waiters to speak of but a serve yourself area full of bread, pastries, hot and cold drinks, fruit, cereal and hot food - sausages, hash browns, eggs and beans. A nice touch at breakfast were paper cups and bags for a takeaway breakfast (or a few extra croissants to eat later in the day!).

The rooms are just like the other Staybridge Suites - spacious, well equipped, fantastic kitchen/bathroom and sparkling clean. Free Wifi works, albeit slowly at times. Breakfast is good, although at weekends it becomes a little crowded when everyone typically eats between 9-10am. On weekdays people tend to eat spread between 7-10am so much calmer and spacious in the kitchen. Views from the hotel are awesome... with rooms on floors 8 to 12. Try and request a room that faces the Olympic park -  you can also see the Millennium Dome (O2 arena), Canary Wharf, Ghurker, and the new Shard and the even newer Mittal Orbit.  If you get a room facing the other side, you can still enjoy views of the city from the reception-level loungeParking... the Westfield car park (the recommended car park) is now closed until after the Olympics (mid September 2012) and the next nearest car park (the older Stratford Shopping Centre - £25 for 24 hours) is only a few minutes walk from the hotel. This is fine, but as it's the only car park near Westfield, it was very busy. Importantly, this will also be closed from 21st July until after the Olympics.So... we used ParkAtMyHouse.com - a website where people can rent out their driveway. There are several people near the Westfield centre who are renting their driveways - we parked at one person's house just 12 minutes walk from the hotel and was very convenient, and also cheaper than the car parks. In short we loved everything about it - the rooms, the location, the views etc. We will think about staying here next time we go to central London - a great location for Westfield and just an underground trip away from the middle of town.",June 2012,5.0,48,Traveled with friends,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

First impressions were that teh directions were not clear enough and I had a tour of the Westfield complex bfore I found the hotel. But, once I had found it I was suitably impressed. The reception area is part of a series of areas interlinked to form relaxing and eating spaces. The reception is unexpectantly on the top (12th) floor. From here you can relax and enjoy the scenary of the City or the Olympic complex laid out before you.This hotel was a new concept for me. It is a building full of suites, which have self contained kitchen and cooking areas. From close to reception you can buy produce from the fridges or off the shelf - milk, fruit juices, cans of beans, bread...loads of stuff. Ther room was wasted on me to be honest. I was on a whistle stop one night business stay, getting in late and leaving early with a dinner out in between. Not enough time to appreciate the spaciousness and comfort of the suite. it had a living area with sofa and TV, kitchen space, separate (and roomy) bedroom with bathroom. I could have spent a lot of time there comfortably.Breakfast was a plentyful and varied and a bit DIY, in a nice way. Bit like being in your own kitchen. For example, fruit juices were kept in a large fridge in 2 litre bottles, pour what you want, not dispensed. Same with milk and other things.I really liked the relaxed almost home from home atmosphere, it was spacious, spotless and comfortable beyond belief and super convinient for transport. But, all this comfort and convinience comes at a price....and a very reasonable one it is too. V. Impressed with VFM.

I had concerns that it was too far out of central London but there are multiple ways of getting about. At one end of the mall, near M&S is Stratford station and the tube line. The central line takes about 25 mins to Tottenham Court Road. At the other end of the mall near Waitrose is Stratford International and its super train, the 'Javelin'. For about £5 you can be at St Pancras in 6 minutes! This is going to be a great service during the Olympics.So, in summary, I'd stay here every time I visit the city now.

Only other negative comment would be that the reception staff were over familiar, which I find quite awkward and intrusive. It's also not necessary for reception staff to show you to your room, or they should at least ask rather than just do it. Finally room service pushed the trolly all the way in to the room which was also unexpected and awkward as someone was in bed. I would expect them to ask if they are ok to come all the way in first.",December 2019,4.0,1,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

They upgraded us to a bigger room which was lovely! Very clean (apart from some blood on our bathroom door which I guess is easily missed as they are sliding doors). They left us a lovely cake and message which was also lovely! Before we arrived I preordered a bottle of prosecco (which was meant to be a surprise until they mentioned it in front of my partner at reception) and so we waited not long and it came to the room. They even told us it was complimentary which again was very kind! Annoyingly it was then charged to my room and I only knew once we had left, such a shame as we ordered another few bottles, had dinner and breakfast there too! I tried to email just to ask but didn’t hear back. Overall a lovely stay with lovely modern decor.

Most notably Apple TV mirroring which allowed us to watch Netflix etc on the rooms TV, via our smartphone.

It is not a buffet and you have to select any one item from a small menu. We were later told as a special case we could have anything from the menu but the restaurant staff were still unclear. I ended up eating the exact same breakfast for 5 days. The breakfast is freshly cooked so service is very slow and not ideal if you are on business. The coffee was usually cold and watery.Other than the breakfast service a great hotel to stay with extremely friendly staff and efficient service.

We had brunch in the brasserie with a G&T, being a vegan I was worried that the options would be limited, like most hotels. However the selection was great, cauliflower burger to die for. The transport options are amazing, DLR, Stratford International, Jubilee line. Plus the shopping at Westfield was worth spending the whole weekend.

The Stratford Hotel,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Sam Pegg,Amazing stay!,"We booked a nights stay on 21st September and I can honestly say that The Stratford is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. A large part of this is down to each and every member of their amazing staff, who helped make our stay so wonderful. The hotel is next to the Westfield Centre, which is fantastic for food, drinks and shopping. Very close to the Olympic stadium/West Ham, and next to Stratford International, so perfect as a base to explore London. On arrival we were greeted by Sue and booked in by Inga. Both made us feel so welcome and the checking in process was very quick and efficient.We were allocated room 505 which was a king sized room. Sue showed us to our room and took great time and care showing us all of the facilities and how to use the room tablet for anything we needed. Our room was a lovely size, very contemporary in design, but still warm and cosy. The rooms have all been designed with great care and thoughtfulness. There were plenty of electrical sockets around the room and on both sides of the bed(even European ones), and a wireless iPhone charger. These were a huge bonus considering a lot of hotels do not take it into consideration. There was a well stocked and very reasonably priced mini bar and snack basket, along with a proper coffee machine. These were all neatly stored away in their own area behind doors. In this area was also a proper hairdryer, as opposed to those things hotels claim are hairdryers, attached to a wall. The wardrobes were of good size, which contained a robe, slippers and hoodie. The bathroom was pristine, with a walk in shower and a lovely range of complementary toiletries that were more akin to a day spa that a hotel. The only thing I could possibly find a fault with is that the water pressure was not so great, and if it was better, then it would be absolutely perfect. We especially loved the many lighting options for the room and bathroom. Unlike other reviews, we loved the movement activated lighting near the bathroom. The light isn’t bright and it was welcomed in the middle of the night. The bed! The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, and the bedding and pillows were unbelievably comfortable. Along with the black out curtains, thick windows and a great air con system, we had a fantastic nights sleep. We had a few drinks in the hotel bar/restaurant when we returned from our evening out and again, found the staff to be welcoming and friendly. A wonderful range of drinks and cocktails too. We didn’t eat in the restaurant, but the menu looked lovely. We already had a late check out, but were thrilled when we received a message saying that because of the rain, we could check out at 2pm. This was a lovely touch as we didn’t want to move! We ordered breakfast in bed and it was cooked to perfection. We very reluctantly had to check out and were helped by yet more friendly staff. I cannot sing the staffs praises enough. Every single member we came across were friendly, polite and helpful. We shall most definitely be returning to The Stratford.

Friendly staff let down by one individual.,"Check in - speedy and friendlyRoom - plush and comfortable HOWEVERThe backlight in the lower bathroom would not turn off meaning we had to shut our bathroom door in order to sleep in darkness.The design is generally very slick but the design of cupboard doors is a pain because there are no handles. Did the builders forget these?Facilities - We were looking forward to our view and meal at Allegra as promised online but on arrival we were told ir wasn’t yet open, disappointment here.The downstairs bar was well stocked with a great selection of malt whiskey, wine and local products (try the local pilsner as it’s very good! Also there’s is a low alcohol pilsner also made locally which is also good). However the bar was slightly unfinished, perhaps the builders are behind schedule as no light fittings, just concrete.The evening barman (guy with glasses) was fantastic. He was friendly, chatty and was happy to recommend things to suit our tastes. The waitresses were very friendly and accommodating and one member of staff even brought my jacket up to my room as I’d left it downstairs.Sadly, the staff was let down by one particular member, a bar managed called Pablo. He was arrogant and only seemed to want to serve us after we had changed into slightly smarter dress. He was condescending when handing us the menu, his product knowledge wasn’t up to scratch. It seemed as if we weren’t good enough for him until we bought more expensive items. Overall - really enjoyed stay, felt relaxed and comfortable but the said barman really got to me and one was made to feel slightly unwelcome, and once he took over the bar, we retreated to our room. The room had great sound system, tv and entertainment options and minibar nicely stocked. Robes and hoodies for comfort and a nice coffee machine provided. The bed and pillows were comfy and the blackout curtains ensured a good night sleep. If possible ask for higher room for better view.

The Stratford Hotel,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,LucyandJase,A gem in the heart of East London,We stayed at The Stratford during August with our 5 year old daughter. From the moment you step in the door you can tell the hotel thrives itself on making sure guests have the best possible experience. The place is luxurious in every aspect.The concierge was incredibly helpful to highlight the many things to do around the area and how to get there etc. After check in our bags were taken to our room whilst we had a relaxing drink in the bar; all the staff were all so friendly and attentive and made our little girl feel like a princess. The decor is modern but tasteful and the rooms are not lacking in mod cons. The bed was heavenly and the bath was amazing. We didn’t eat dinner in the hotel as we were meeting friends but did have breakfast the following morning. The great thing about this place is the food is cooked to order so not sat under a hot plate going hard and dry. You can switch things up to suit your own tastes if there is something you aren’t keen on. The restaurant staff seemed more than willing to accommodate our specific likes and dislikes. You just have to ask! This was our first time visiting East London and I love it so much more than Central London in terms of atmosphere. The hotel is really well positioned next to the station and the shopping centre. Well done to the management at the Stratford who are clearly working incredibly hard to make this new hotel a success.

Our room was pleasant and had all the amenities you would expect. I slept extremely well - the bed was lovely and it was like sleeping in a cloud!Breakfast was unusual, in that it was all made to order. As we had paid for breakfast in the price, we were given a selection of things we could choose from. This seemed both mean and wasteful, as we were given items we didn't want, yet couldn't have other things we wanted without paying extra. I felt this hotel was aimed at the trendy hipster market, rather than me and my hubby. It all looked lovely, but it had no soul or anything really to make it stand out. Apart from breakfast I couldn't fault it, hence the 4 star review.

The Stratford Hotel,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Benita_and_Peter,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed here using secret escapes offer.  There are lots of positives - staff exceptional (Rita / Gary plus a few others whose names i didn't know / couldn't remember).  Standard room is great in size, quality of finish good, hairdryer can be plugged in by a mirror!  Would have benefited from a bit more storage for clothes and bits & bobs - the stand for the bedside lights looked great and we were expecting it to have draws in it or something, but nothing - unless they were super well hidden!   It would also have been good to have 2 easy chairs rather than just the one. No noise transference of any significance either inside or from outside.  There were 2 things that were of disappointment to us - for our stay the skygarden wasn't open as the restaurant wasn't ready - a big push in the blurb was about enjoying the superb views over the london skyline and this was one of the first things we'd asked about when we first checked in - while Rita kindly gave us a tour of the one on the 25th floor, it's not the same as being able to sit up there with a drink - especially when the view from the hotel room is over the train lines and the loading bay area for the Westfield Centre with nothing of the skyline visible.  The other thing is the breakfast - the hotel goes for an a la carte rather than a buffet set up.  Breakfast was inclusive in our rate, however could have been super carb heavy as you had one option plus toast and pastries. Breakfasts away are one of the joys of staying in a hotel, and we like a mixture.  It seemed strange to be able to order a fruit bowl (£6) on the menu or an eggs Royale (£12) or a full english (£14) and have these all treated as one option.  Gary and the other staff understood our dilemma and we ended up doing a pick and mix, replacing the toast and pastries for me with fresh fruit, and sharing so that we could enjoy a broader selection.  The food was great and portions generous (i.e. 2 pieces of toast each with avocado and poached egg on, or 2 muffins each with egg benedict on) -  it was just not as relaxing an experience as we would have liked when we were having to explain this each time we got new staff (we stayed 6 nights).  Also by having everything served to you it did make the breakfast quite slow - we were sometimes waiting for 30 mins after placing our order and nearly every day something was forgotten.  One suggestion would be for the cooked food to give the option for a small portion or a full portion, so that for inclusive rates you could naturally have more of a selection.  Staff were all super keen for our feedback during our stay which we did provide - when i got the feedback email i was going to put all this to them direct, but got routed immediately to trip advisor!",July 2019,5.0,41,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,5.0,5.0,5.0

It is beautifully designed modern hotel that has some neat with gadgets and tech. The hotel us ideally located for pretty much anything with the added bonus if Westfield bring on your doorstep. The staff really made you feel special, their attentiveness and attention to detail, made such a difference. From what I could tell they were consistent in apply this level of hospitality to all guests. Given that the hotel hasn’t been open for very long, yes they had one or two around the hotel things to correct but they were up front about it so that’s fair. We ate in the brasserie the second night and oh how I wish I ate there on the first night, the whole chicken to share  was exceptionally cooked and wonderfully seasoned, the hassleback potatoes came a close second in the “how yummy was that” statement. The breakfasts were also delicious and if I were picky I’d say this is the one area where things  could be improved. Tea needs to brew before pouring, staff were a bit quick of the mark on that . Bread really needs a bit longer under the grill to be called toast, we and other tables had to return “the warm bread” to be toasted and lastly, warming the pastry’s first would be a lovely touch and bring out the best in them, it would raise them from being just ok to totally awesome. When most of the service you get is so good it equally can highlight the little things that need a bit more work. Suffice to say before I end up rambling on more than I have already, we would without a doubt be back again if our budget allows.

The Stratford Hotel,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Nina,Terrible service at high price,"I stayed at the Stratford in mid-June, when the hotel was not officially open yet, which was a surprise to me. The lobby was essentially a construction site, and I walked back and forth multiple times before deciding to ask for directions at what looked like an entrance for residents. It turns out that that was the ""reception"".The room turned out to be a newly furnished one-bedroom apartment with amazing views. There was even a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for me. So far, so good.But: there were not bathroom amenities. There was no hairdryer. There was not even a power outlet in the bathroom. There was no reasonably placed power outlet in the kitchen. Surprisingly, there was a water cooker, which I had to operate on the floor. There was no TV. Now, none of this would be reason for me to complain, except that I paid >225 pounds per night and I do expect a fully operational hotel and a fully equipped room at this price.And worst of all, on the morning of my departure, there was no hot water, which is really bad when you have very long hair and were in need of washing it.Given this experience, I'd expect some sort of refund or compensation. But all the hotel staff told me was that they were pleased to let me know that the hotel opened two days after my departure and that they would love to welcome me back to deliver a different experience, supposedly at a preferable rate, a free breakfast and a free upgrade.Thanks, but no thanks.

The hotel had only been open for 3 weeks so everything was glossy and new. I stayed in a medium room which had a good sized desk space for me to work from as well as a really nice arm chair. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I slept really well.  The bathroom was a good size with a lovely walk in shower.

The hotel is within the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and a 1 mnute walk to the huge Westfield shopping mall.  As a solo female traveller I felt extremely safe as there are seurity at the entrance and you have to use your room key to use the lift. The  reason I didn't give my stay 5 stars was due to the construction noise which was going on during the day through out my stay and a few little missing touches from the room which I'd expect such as a bottle opener, a kettle (The coffee machine was a nice touch but if you just want hot water for tea it's a bit of a pain!) and a little guide to the room would have been appreciated as I didn't realise some of the cool features until the day I was leaving!  Also there is a light outside of the bathroom which is motion sensitive and stays on for ages which I felt was uneccesary and rather annoying in the middle of the night!

From start to finish the experience was exceptional. We felt like every one of the staff we met were old friends the way they greeted us and chatted to us. The rooms were stunning - every tiny detail is beautiful and I wished we could’ve stayed longer so I could take more baths - I couldn’t get enough of the bathroom! Also loved the sculpture in the centre of the hotel - so cool.We had coffee and snacks in the lounge on the ground floor and Federica was so super friendly and gave us some great ideas on what to do during our stay plus she recommended what to pick from the menu when we eat in the brasserie and all the recommendations were delicious. Really excited to come back and try more.Had no idea that Stratford was so accessible to central London too - a 7minute train and we were in Kings Cross!,July 2019,5.0,9,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Away from home and after way too long a day at work I arrived late and exhausted, to my delight it felt like this place scooped me up, enveloped me and took care of exactly what I needed. My room catered for everything I needed and beyond....if I had  forgotten my charger and needed to buy a new one I could have....along with slippers and a robe there was also a comfy Stratford hoodie. A deep sleep in a fantastically comfortable bed was followed by a delicious breakfast of avocado smash on toast with poached eggs washed down with very good cappuccino. I would definitely stay again.

The Stratford Hotel,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,MrandMrsTuck,Will be a nice hotel when finished.,"I booked two nights at the Stratford hotel whilst staying in London for a work conference. I'd requested a quiet room, which are internal facing so unfortunately do not come with a view but do offer quiet.The rooms offer comfy beds, nice toiletries and cool in-room technology, however several aspects of the room were not working yet, for example; large rain shower offers little to no pressure and temperature cold, and a light comes on in room when there is movement and which cannot be switched off (annoying when you've got up in the middle of the night).The hotel offers a 24-hour gym but this wasn't ready when I stayed. Frustratingly, staff could not communicate when it would be available, with guidance ranging from within next 24 hours to one more week. Staff did book me into a Better Gym about 3 mins walkaway as an alternative, however this took about 30 mins to process which eroded my workout time.Staff were nice and worked hard to make it up to guests, however this hotel was not ready to be open yet.Restaurant and bar area are nice.

The Stratford Hotel,4.0,4.5,Excellent,4.5,5.0,4.5,Sarah Bradbury,Room for improvement,"I’m usually a premier inn/ibis kind of girl (to be honest a caravan works good for me) but this weekend I was in London for a special occasion so thought I’d choose a ‘proper’ hotel.I booked my room at the Stratford on 19th November 2018, for a stay on 29th June 2019. At no point during the 7 months between booking, and arriving, did anybody inform me the hotel wasn’t even open. It didn’t officially open until the day after I checked out, but had unofficially opened 5 days prior to my arrival. Had I known before I was paying full price for a room in a hotel that was operating at only 70/80% efficiency, and who were basically using me as a guinea pig to pick up any issues before their grand opening, I most certainly would have looked elsewhere. Leading up to my stay I received numerous emails, many of which told me I had just 24 (or 48) hours to confirm the information requested or my booking would not be confirmed - this was after I’d already had emails telling me my room was confirmed (one was asking for my home address, which they still managed to get wrong - I live on the south coast of the UK, yet the address they put for me was somewhere in NYC - I love the states but don’t fancy living in New York). I did enjoy the email though which asked me for my email address (I’ll let you think about that one).Before I booked I read through the reviews to see what people were saying - oddly all of those have now disappeared and they are only showing ones from June of this year. Of the many I read (which I now think were taken from the reviews of the Stratford Loft Apartments (their sister building)) 90% of them mentioned the “Amazing views”. I guess if you like train tracks, multi storey car parks and warehouse/storage entrances, then ‘yes’ you’d think the view amazing. My brother-in-law travels a lot for work and is a member of a group who share their worst hotel views; even he said I was “onto a winner” with ours. Even now a section for reviews of the hotel states people love it for it’s “Fab Views”.The reception desk is in the most ridiculously inconvenient area it could have been. Tucked around the corner from the main entrance (I had to ask a surly looking security guard where it was who just pointed at a lady coming my way (she was lovely and could not have been more helpful)) I was then directed to a desk in front of the 3 lifts with very little room in between. When all 3 computers are being used at the desk whoever is on the right hand end will have to stand slightly away from the counter as there is not enough room. If you then get a couple more people wanting to get to the desk, you have no hope of exiting/entering the furthest of the 3 lifts as this is where people will be queueing to check out (during my stay this was also the only lift working). Luckily when I checked in I was the only person, but if there were more than 4 wanting to at the same time and they queued the other end (which would be most logical) none of the lifts would be accessible. During my stay the staff also had to use the same lift and I felt quite sorry for the poor lady who had 2 trolleys of leftover room service food she had to get back to the kitchen for she was unable to squeeze in with guests and had to keep waiting until she could get in with guests, or just hang around until it was empty.I booked a twin room as I was originally sharing with a male cousin of mine; I’m now quite glad he had to cancel and I drafted my Mum in last minute as the twin setup is basically a double bed with 2 single mattresses either side with your own sheet/quilt. I’m not someone who has intimacy issues but even I would have felt uncomfortable being quite-so-close to someone I don’t normally share with. Unless you (or whomever you share with) are people who lay straight and don’t move then you will (at-some-point) come into contact with your roommate during the night. They were, however, extremely comfortable and I could happily have taken the pillows home with me. You could tell the room was new; the smell of the paint still hung in the air. This was fine to begin with but after a while was quite headache inducing and as there are no windows to open (not such a bad thing with the train station outside) there was no way to remove it or help to disperse it a little. The bathroom (being so new) is lovely, although whoever thought it a good idea to put the toilet roll holder directly next to the toilet itself on the same level really needs to try using it. Anyone over a size 12 is going to find it digs in to your leg and is in the most ridiculous place to try to pull some off. We took ours off (the paper, not the holder) and popped it onto the edge of the sink. The walk in shower was lovely except the water pressure was quite low and the shower head (although fabulously large) only produced water from one side; these were slow, huge drops. The additional spray attachment is pretty much useless for anything other than rinsing off your feet; it never quite made it to trickle, choosing instead to stay at the dribble stage. The shower gels, shampoos and conditioner are-what-they-are.The aircon was ok; we set ours to the minimum of 18, yet the room temperature never dropped under 22. Tucking the coffee machine into the cupboard is a great idea (to keep the desk area tidy and uncluttered) right up until the point when you go to use it. To pop a pod in for coffee you need to lift the handle up high; this cannot be done unless you drag the machine to the very edge of the shelf, therefore having to balance it a little. The cups (which in themselves are tiny) then don’t sit quite right on the ledge under the water spout, so you have to keep hold of them at all times or else they run the risk of sliding off and spilling everywhere. 4 coffee pods, 3 different teas (2 of each variety) is a nice touch but just 2 of the silly little milk pod things doesn’t quite work. I assume this is to encourage you to then purchase a cup of tea from either room service, or downstairs; at £3 per cup I stuck to water (of which you do get one complimentary jug left in your room).There are plenty of plug sockets to use, all of which have usb charging which is great and the TV is huge ( be aware though some channels only give you sound and not the picture). If you are on the train station side of the hotel you will hear the tannoy announcements word-for-word and trains do run from 5am until well after midnight.My biggest bug bear though was the light in the little cubby area outside the bathroom. This had no on/off switch and it appeared to work either on a sensor or timer of some kind. If, like me, you like a dark room to sleep in make sure you do not enter the bathroom or this little area for at least half-an-hour before you want to go to sleep and whatever you do, do not get up in the night to use the bathroom, for this light comes on, and stays on. What makes is worse is that it is opposite a full length mirror so the light is reflected all around the room. Great for someone who doesn’t like sleeping in the dark but really should be optional for those of us who do. Maybe once their teething problems are sorted it will be better for people staying, for the location is great if you’re visiting Westfield, or the London Stadium, but for me, and my stay, I can honestly say it was not worth the cost and in future I’ll stick to the premier’s; at least with those you get-what-you-pay-for.The one thing I cannot fault though (other than the security guard) is the staff. From the lovely girl who lead us around to the reception, to the lift guys, the luggage guys and even the girl shifting the food trolleys around, nothing was too-much-trouble and they were all extremely courteous and friendly. In fact the girl who guided us to the reception area (I believe her name was Emma?  very pretty girl with long braided hair) was the most courteous and friendly member of staff I have come across anywhere, in any business.I'm sure once officially opened and operating as should be things will improve but for me I personally won't be recommending, or booking to stay again any time soon.",June 2019,3.0,164,Traveled with family,2.0,-1,-1,5.0,3.0,-1

On arrival, the staff were lovely and the hotel was on its way to looking incredible - however unfinished. Our room was perfect, but the water pressure in the shower was poor. My partner runs every morning, so our only filter when looking for a hotel is a gym. The gym was made to sound fantastic and with great equipment. This meant it was really disappointing when we arrived and the gym was not open yet. We were initially told it would be open the following day, however when we asked the following day, were then told it would not be until the following week. It was only then that we were offered use of a nearby gym should we wish to use it, the hotel would refund us. Communication seemed poor and a lot of mixed messages. We were given complimentary dinner at The Stratford Brasserie which was delicious. No offer of breakfast, we weren’t sure if dining was an option at breakfast or only room service.

This Hotel is perfect location for walking distance for the train stations and the Westfield shopping centre. The hotel is relatively new, several floors, you check in at the bar.The lift to the floors require you to tap your key card to use them. I was in a queen room, adequate size, but the bathroom is very small, but i`m not dancing in there, shower good and hot.The room does not have any beverage facilities at all, but it has a hair dryer lol.It you want a brew you have to go down stairs to use the kettle at the end of the bar. TV - mine stopped working, had to get one of the maids nearby who was brilliant and fixed it....It appears the tv is connected by the internet.  You pull the surround away from the tv at its base and just unplug and re plug to the power and Lan line re-boot. BAD POINT - this hotel is boiling.  You are unable to change the room temperature using the wall thermostat.  Mine was set at 24.5 decrees c throughout.  When I tried to get the air con working it actually went hotter.  Apparently the whole hotel is set at this temp. IF you want the room cooling you have to open the window for the whole day...bring your ear plugs.Bed is comfortable.I didnt eat here but from what I could see its continental breakfast only for a premium price.The hotel is spotless, but you cannot have a hotel this warm without being able to control the temperature, especially when outside is 8 degrees.

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,MRMARKV,Uncomfortable temperatures,The hotel is in fair condition even after just two years of opening; with carpets and bar already looking rather sketchy.As a Marriott Titanium Member we were given an interior courtyard view room: so much for the best available room guarantee.One night there was a 10 minute procedure before we could actually pay for two bottles of water and put it on our room as we “weren’t registered” (we had checked in online). On the day of departure maid service started knocking on the door at 09:30 - with the DND on.Wordt though - with an outside temperature of 8C in December the lowest we temperature we could achieve in the room was 23C (that was after 3 days with the window open); that is just not acceptable for a fairly newly constructed building - where is the sustainability and guest comfort in that: complaining to the front desk didn’t help either.The location is pretty good; but if this issue is not solved (I can’t imagine what it would be like in summer!) I would not return anytime soon....,December 2019,2.0,398,not mentioned,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,Jade S,On the whole good,"First of all - we spent minimal time in the hotel except for sleeping and chilling but when we were there, a few important points worth mentioning. We were placed on the 5th floor to the front of the building - very noisy with traffic and unfortunately there were nightshift roadworks the whole night on our first evening. Not the hotels fault I completely understand but brings me on to my next point. The rooms were absolutely roasting - they had no air con facilities as it was set hotel wide to “winter mode”. Our room was measuring 26C for our 4 night stay and we couldn’t open the window to sleep because of the noise outside, giving us 4 pretty sleepless nights and feeling ill with the heat most mornings. We asked on 2 occasions at reception on 2 separate days if could this be put down but nothing changed. The smoke alarm - albeit for our safety (and we were grateful) had 2 bright lights flashing from it and when dark in the room lit up the entire place every 60 seconds - very off putting when you’re roasting hot, trying to fall asleep, too much traffic noise outside to open the window. It just made a difficult situation more difficult. We asked about this again but nothing changed. The TV only worked intermittently. It worked on the first evening and then not after that at all. We tried all channels and nothing worked. We couldn’t even connect our phones to watch films as this didn’t work either. The USB socket at the bed side didn’t work so we had to share one plug - we didn’t bring more as hotel specifically advertised USB plugs. The tea, coffee and water is down at reception which is a bit off putting having to traipse all the way down to reception for a tea / coffee early morning if you’re in your pjs etc. The ironing rooms on each floor is a great idea, but only great when they work. We had to go up and down to use the iron as the one on our floor didn’t work. There was a ticking in our room for 4 nights - no idea where this came from but it was driving us ballistic! We couldn’t find out the source! These probably seem like very minor issues but lots of minor issues lead up to a bigger issue and while the Moxy costs pale in insignificance to other hotels in the area and in wider London we still paid a substantial amount of money for our stay and it just wasn’t at the standard we would have expected. HOWEVER - the Moxy concept is fantastic and we would definitely stay again but we would expect a better standard of service next time around, especially being a member of the Marriot Club. PROS - Great break out areas, facilities clean, hotel smells FANTASTIC - I need to know what it is! Rooms spotless and modern, trendy and cool, great selection of food and drinks, staff so friendly, relaxed vibes!! it’s right up our street without all the teething problems!

Decided to stay at Stratford as the other was booked up. Upon arrival, I showed the booking confirmation of which she saw the price and instantly said that was wrong. There was no welcome, no welcome drink, nothing. Straight to pointing out the price for the room on my booking was wrong. And then she plucked a figure out of thin air to charge, of which I refused. I asked if we could be given a higher room as feels like the people walking by can see in the window, she instantly denied and said it’s 1st floor only. There had been 2/3 rooms already checked in beside us whilst we had still been seen, all had also been offered a welcome drink. Once she had located our booking, she proceeded to take payment at the higher price of which I refused as my booking showed the price I booked for. The manager came and said it was no issue and charged me the price I had booked for. As I paid cash, she instantly demanded another £50 deposit of which I had no problem providing. But her manner in which she was asking, it made us feel very unwelcome. The worst service I have ever received at a hotel. Probably took around 25 minutes to check in, in contrast to the other Excel hotel which took 5 minutes every time. Upon checking out, I asked for my deposit back of which they could not find. I waited a further 15 minutes. I mentioned to a colleague it was probably in the till but she did not tell the person I was dealing with and let her rummage around in the back wasting my time yet again. Then she looked in the till and found it. Very unprofessional, no people skills and very unwelcoming.

We then were told that is only applicable if it’s parent and child- leaving us with no where to stay. They refunded one of us- which wouldnt come for 3/5 days so when we said we literally had no where to go the ‘supervisor’ told us that ‘we have parents and they can send you the money’- like we hadn’t already spent £150 on the hotel! They wouldn’t refund the other room as apparently it was cancelled, even though the money came out of our bank.

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,jord920,Not a hotel for business travellers.,"Entered the hotel and first impressions were that is very different to a traditional Marriott hotel, it was young and fun. Very different. We waited to be checked in for a few minutes which was fine. On check in the crew member explained we were on a corporate prepaid rate with £10 breakfast allowance and £23 dinner allowance and that was it. No explanation of how breakfast works, where the rooms were allocated or where parking was. Just pointed to across the road. We were allocated first floor rooms. On arrival at the room I was impressed, it’s modern and relatively clean - the glass side tables looked terrible. We went to the bar and the Stella was off for both nights we stayed. With only one lager on tap and bottled beers. After a drink we went back to our room, where I found there was no bin in the room except for the one in the bathroom. Not sure why. My welcome message on the TV said “Hello Michael” - again not sure why? The bed when you got into it was strangely crinkly... I laid in bed for 5 minutes and could hear music from the lobby. I tried to play a podcast to cover the bass noise coming through the floor but it did not work. What was so irritating was the fact I had no telephone in my room to call downstairs as “we’d love to see you” so I had to get dressed and head into the lobby. I waited a few minutes while the person looking after the desk/bar finished with the person he was serving before coming to me. He did tell me he wouldn’t be too long so I was fine with that. When he got to me I said I’d been put in a room above the lobby speaker and could I be changed rooms as I wouldn’t be able to sleep. He said that the music would be turned down now so he could do that for me. I said well what time will it be turned down as I was here on a business trip so needed to sleep. It was 1am already and I had travelled down that evening so would have liked to have been asleep by now. The crew member explained that the music is turned off around now. So I said tomorrow that doesn’t help me as I don’t want to be awake until 1am again so could I just move rooms. He genuinely seemed as if this was a massive issue, I wasn’t happy with my room so why could he not have just changed it for me?? I left the desk feeling more agitated than when I went down. Why should I have to fight my case to be given a peaceful room when the room was booked through a business code? Is it completely ridiculous to want a good night’s sleep at a hotel? Because that is how I was made to feel. This is clearly not a business travellers hotel and aimed at a party culture. The second night’s sleep was amazing - but I imagine that being so tired from the previous night is the reason why. The shower in the room is amazing. It was refreshing to wake up to. We didn’t have breakfast on either days as we didn’t understand how it worked and as there was no breakfast instructions given on check in saved the embarrassment and paid for breakfast at work. Surely a “have you stayed with us before” would have been helpful on check in so these things could have been explained. This hotel is a million miles away from the traditional Marriott which is just so welcoming and user friendly, I felt like the Moxy was not and the crew members did not do their best to help guests have the best stay they could. On check out the crew member attempted to charge us for the stay, if another crew member had come along I’m not sure what would have happened as we hadn’t been asked to swipe an authorising card so clearly it was a prepaid room. It was another issue that didn’t make the stay go smoothly. In reflection I’d choose to stay with another hotel instead of the Moxy when I have to book travel with work - there were some positives however the negatives felt like real challenges for basic service needs. Putting business travellers on the first floor is a stupid idea when lobby music is played until at least 1am.",October 2019,2.0,34,Traveled on business,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Room temperature was easy to adjust and there is a light under the bed so that if you get up in the middle of the night it lights your path which is super cool.

Eventually we got our key and the room was fine, iv stayed in a moxy before in Amsterdam so I knew what the rooms were like, and I enjoy the layout. The only issues was the shower filled up so if you were in there for a half decent amount of time you panicked it would overflow onto the floor. The bed sheet isn't fitted so that kept coming off the mattress during the night which is pretty irritating. Other then these issues the room was clean, the location of the hotel is perfect, I couldn't hear the trains go by.

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,Theresa O,Excellent customer service in an Excellent location!,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Moxy Stratford for 5 nights last week. The location is great. Steps away from Stratford station and Mall, with all types of shops and restaurants.  Initially I was a little surprised at the minimalist, edgy presentation of the hotel. But it is quite charming and very satisfying. The rooms are clean with great showers. The breakfast is good and filling for a 4 star hotel. But I must Say, The service was exceptional! The management and staff that I interacted with throughout my stay were 5 Star. Luca the manager, was so helpful and responsive. It seemed like he was there in the lobby 24/7 but he was always delightful to see and eager to assist with questions, directions, suggestions. Efficiently responding to any concern.Clearly, Guest satisfaction is important to him. And the team definitely takes a cue from Luca. Gloria who checked me in was sparkling and attentive. I enjoyed the welcome drink, and she took the time to explain all the amenities and breakfast selection. I highly recommend The Moxy Stratford and will definitely return because of the excellent guest service. Hopefully next time a room with the lovely little balcony will be available. I am a Marriot  Bonovoy loyalist will be looking for Moxy hotels at home in the U.S.  Thank you for a wonderful stay in the UK. Luca!Theresa B",October 2019,5.0,5,Traveled solo,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,Haley622,Shady Moxy,"This hotel is cute but small. It does not have the amenities of other Marriott hotels. They don’t have ironing boards/ irons, no face towels and community soap which the y refill the container. No garbage can in the room but 1 tiny trash can in bathroom. Thin comforter in bed with flimsy pillows. No safety bar on the door to keep people out even if they’re able to unlock the door. Most importantly no room safe. My credit card was stolen from my purse that was left inside my luggage. I used the card to check into the hotel and put it back in my wallet with all the other cards. The next day I took my debit card and my 2 credit cards out of my wallet and left all my department store cards and that Marriott card in the wallet inside the purse. I was going to a NFL game so I only took a small clear purse with me. After returning from the game I wanted place everything back in my other purse and noticed every department store card was there and Marriott card was missing. My husband and I looked around the room to make sure it wasn’t there. I did not report it to the front desk because I have no proof. I only used this card to pay for our room at checkin. I swiped the card in the machine myself and placed it back into my wallet. After that we went straight up stairs to our room. In my opinion this is not a safe hotel. We had about 25 people with us at this hotel. Our friends were afraid to leave their two 15 year old and 19 year old in the room for a few hours by themselves even though the grandmother was on the same floor. I was definitely a bit nervous at night because there is no safety latch on the door. Of course the door locks but anyone could gain fool access with a key card. We stayed there 3 nights but were gone all day during the day. My friend recommended this hotel because she stayed at one in New York. I would not ever stay in this hotel again. By the way, I cancelled the credit card before I left London. I believe the person was waiting to use it when I checked out the hotel. This way,  I wouldn’t accuse the hotel staff.

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,Emily,Good not great,"Overall this is a decent hotel, and I can see it would be perfect if you need a quick place to crash. The hotel is right next to the station and Westfield so is super easy to travel, go out for food, and buy anything you need. Complimentary drink on arrival is a nice touch, with clean room and nice communal areas. However, I feel overall the hotel is overpriced, I got a discounted rate and still felt that was too much for what was on offer. The room was extremely basic, with no tea or coffee, very small space and not even a bin. Didn't feel like we could relax in the space, so tried to stay out as late as possible. The breakfast is £12 which we decided was excessive considering what was on offer (nothing cooked and very little choice). The staff were friendly but there was only ever one member on the front desk, which left queues when it came to check in and out, annoying when you need to catch a train.

A great modern hotel, lots of socialising space on the ground floor, was very popular.  Minimalist rooms, but less opportunity to leave something behind if there is nowhere to put it!  Lovely fluffy towels, toiletries supplied.  Only thing I was surprised about was that a kettle seemed not to be standard - on arrival I was told that I had been upgraded to a room with a kettle, and even so it came with paper cups, but that was the only difference between the Moxy and other much more expensive places to stay.

This hotel has absolutely everything - and more - that you could need or want for a couple of nights in London. We were over for the Radio 2 Hyde Park concert so just needed a base and this hotel was just perfect. Welcoming check in staff. Spotlessly clean rooms - which were a really good size and a perfectly adequate, modern, clean bathroom with good comfy bed, I’d struggle to find criticism!!Would have liked a bin (spent at least 20 mins looking for one in room!) and the flashing smoke detectors were beyond annoying but could be easily rectified.

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,gemandglenn2017,Cheap stop over while visiting London,"Excellent location with great transport links to the centre, right in the heart of Stratford. It was such good value for money, we knew to expect the basics but were pleasantly surprised. Hotel was a little dirty in the communal areas, the quirky lift writing we've seen in pictures were all rubbed off and we didn't feel very welcomed when we checked in. But as expected for the price. We had a deal on Moxy website where we got free breakfast (they tried it charge us at check in, but easily rectified). Being coeliac i didn't expect to be able to have much apart from the usual yoghurt and coffee, but they had gluten free rolls, gluten free cereal, fruits, ham, cheese... the list goes on. Possibly the best choice of gluten free breakfasts I have ever hat, great detail Moxy! I did have one negative however, it was our anniversary and I had been emailing them on and off for a few weeks, trying to organise one of their quirky room decorations that Ive seen on instagram, they are brilliant! The guy I was chatting with said he can do small ones free of charge or larger paid ones. So we agreed on a small something to surprise my husband. We also requested a high floor (we're on the older side now and like our sleep!). We arrived to our room on the first floor and no decoration at all. Wasn't as issue as like I said, it was such a good deal, just would have been nice as those touches were what made us choose the hotel.

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,ItalianDieguito,"Good value for money, but still below expectations.","Just came back from a 2 nights stay and I am not impressed. I knew it was going to be basic (I picked it only because I needed a Bonvoy hotel last minute and this was cheap), but I was expecting something better.The hotel style is minimal and modern, this meant no wardrobe and no desk in the room, plus close to zero space in the bathroom. No amenities at all (e.g. no toothbrush, no shower-cap, etc.). Anyway, if you know this in advance, it's not the end of the world. PROs: 3min walk from Stratford tube, the entrance/lounge areas look very modern/trendy, bed is ok, very good shower, wi-fi is good both in the lounge and in the rooms (or at least in the 613 where I stayed).  The complimentary glass of sweet alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink upon arrival as nice too.CONs: breakfast (£12) is probably the worst hotel breakfast I ever had. Just filter coffee, almost no fruits selection, low quality charcuterie/cheese and there was also no juice at all, at least on Friday morning between 8:20-8:45am.Moxy doesn't offer all normal benefits for Platinum members (e.g. no free breakfast), however they also did nothing to make the Platinum experience nice. I got the $10 + $10 Food & Beverage credit (a tenner for each guest) and used part of it to pay for breakfast on day 1, leaving £4-5 of credit. My Gf was then going to use it for a drink and I had to argue 5min over the phone (I had to leave early that day) with the manager Luca in order to make this happen, as apparently you cannot use the credit on the day you check out. Non-sense, as till you check out you're still an hotel guest. It was not about the money, it was about the principle and customer service in general. Also, on my first night I arrived at 11:10pm and asked confirmation about the water bottle in the room (99% of hotels in the Bonvoy programme give you 1 or 2 per day). Well, Moxy is in that 1% that provides absolutely nothing. you have to buy one.",August 2019,3.0,62,Traveled on business,-1,4.0,-1,2.0,-1,4.0
Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,Kirsty O,Good hotel,"Visited this hotel for 2 nights whilst on a course in London. Really friendly staff who were more than happy to help, welcoming and polite. The hotel is really modern and the room was lovely and clean with air con at no extra cost. Towels were changed daily, there is a hair dryer in the room. There is also a room where you can iron your clothes I didn’t need to use it but was made aware it was available to use. My room was at the front near a busy road but I had no problems with noise. Stratford station is a 2 minute walk away so good for commuting. The only reason I haven’t given full marks is the food, don’t get me wrong the food I did eat was lovely but there is not a huge selection and they don’t have something as simple as a burger and chips. There are hotdogs on the menus and wedges but you need to buy both separately which then becomes too big a portion. The same with you can get lasagne and wedges separate but i found it too much and wasted some. Breakfast was included I had no complaints with breakfast  as it filled my needs I would normally just have toast, fruit and a yoghurt all were available however if you want a big fry up for breakfast you won’t get it here. The coffee from the machine also isn’t great but boiling water is available if you wanted to take your own.

Moxy London Stratford,3.5,4.0,Very good,4.5,4.5,4.0,shellabella75,Basically a trendy Travelodge...,"Let’s start with the positives! The location of the Moxy is great, being a very short walk from Stratford station. I lived in London for nearly 20 years and was catching up with friends in the East End, so the location was perfect. Other positives are that the bed was fairly comfy and both the shower and hairdryer were powerful (rare to find in many hotels these days). Oh, one really good thing is the light under the bed that comes on automatically when you get up to go to the loo in the night. What a great idea!  I think most of the reviews on here have picked up on most of the negatives - the size of the room and bathroom being the first thing. At least Travelodge rooms have space to swing a cat. I had a young child with me and there was nowhere for us to ‘chill out’ on a seat with there only being one chair in the room. Although the bed was comfy, after 10 minutes in it, the bed sheet became untucked and was rolled up under us which didn’t make for the best night’s sleep. And sleeping became even more difficult with trains trundling past at all hours. Another issue with the room is the lack of tea and coffee. We were told that this was unlimited and available downstairs, but when you have a young child in tow, it’s impossible to pop down and make a brew after putting him to bed!Aside from the room, there is the trendy bar area which doubles as a Reception. We didn’t get the warmest welcome in all honesty when we arrived to check in. The staff all seemed very ‘casual’ and not too concerned about good customer service. We had breakfast included in our stay, which was basically a continental breakfast. The only hot choices were omelettes and baked beans. It was ok - nothing special! Definitely would not have paid for it. Overall, the hotel is functional and well-located. A few touches would make this better such as tea and coffee facilities in rooms, greater professionalism from the staff and more seating options in the bedrooms.",August 2019,3.0,20,Traveled with family,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The hotel is clean, tidy, respectful and quirky. Check in was quick and easy and the hotel is in a great location right next to the Westfield shopping centre, across the road from a small food shopping area and next to the train and tube station. All within very short walking distance. Sadly there were a few things that let the experience down for us. There’s no parking at the hotel however we parked at Westfield shopping centre for 24hours at £15. Great price. On to the room: - It was very cold when we arrived in the room and had to change the air con drastically. - No phone in the rooms you’ll have to go downstairs if you need anything- There’s no wardrobe in the room. - Bathroom is very small and tight. Two people in there would be very personal. - Only two pillows on the bed that were extremely flat so had to request another two pillows. Also had to request a second duvet as, again, it was cold. - The request for extra pillows and the duvet had to be done twice as the first request didn’t seem to go through to the right person. (Having to go downstairs twice) - No tea/ coffee, kettle, glasses or cups -WiFi wouldn’t connect to the laptop. One thing I did really like and thought was different, you need to tap your room key in the lift and then press the floor number in order to access the room. If it’s just a quick stay and you’re not too fussy about the room then this is a great hotel for location, transport and amenities within the area.",August 2019,3.0,10,Traveled as a couple,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
